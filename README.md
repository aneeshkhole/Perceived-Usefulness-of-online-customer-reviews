Abstract

We explore the research performed in Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul ([2022](https://pconnell.github.io/CSCI-Final-Project/references.html#ref-percUse)), and seek to further it via their recommendations for predicting the perceived usefulness of online customer reviews to potential customers. Our work focuses on the expansion and generalization of their multiple linear regression model. To check the modelâ€™s general applicability, we collect additional products and reviews, and do so for the same products from multiple e-commerce websites to examine whether such models are applicable to any platform, or if the models may be platform-specific. Furthermore, we explore use of additional features and coefficients, and use of other prediction and classification models to assess the degree to which a customer review is useful to future customers.
