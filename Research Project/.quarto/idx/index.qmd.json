Having reviews from reliable sources with sufficiently detailed information can enable greater confidence in a purchase, improved customer satisfaction, and smooth the process of ecommerce for customers.\n\nWe seek to expound upon the research of *paper reference here* to explore additional recommended research areas, in the direction\n\n## What / Where\n<!-- -->\n*(Citation)* provided the following areas for recommended additional research at the conclusion of their paper: <!--PC-->\n\n* Expand the number of products beyond 3 items (one search, one experience, one mixed)\n\n* Explore customer metadata for classifying reviewer types <!--Team - I don't know that we can actually go about getting customer metadata.  This may be a bridge too far for us unless the site(s) we identify can provide such information--> \n\nWe seek to explore Item #1 and #2 above and explore the possibility of assessing a scale for products to determine the extent to which they are a search-based or an experience-based product. We've explored additonal research from other teams to identify additional potential methods\n\n* Determine the polarity of a customer review by employing a classifier such as Naive Bayes. <!--AK talk about Naive Bayes, Kansei Method-->\n\n* Use Kansei engineering approaches to convert unstructured product-related texts into feature–affective opinions.  \n\n* Try to identify if a customer’s review is ‘reliable’ based on star-rating and textual feedback ‘sentiment score’.  <!--UK - talk about Customer Reliability methods--> \n\nWe seek to examine additional products and product types between multiple e-commerce websites (BestBuy, Target, Amazon).\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n<!--PC--> \n\nFeedback from customers is beneficial, but it is not always ordered by the most informative or beneficial feedback first.  Certain features of data such as... can impact the usefulness of the feedback on a customer-by-customer basis.  Level of detail, star-rating, and number of votes that support the review as being useful to a customer can all help determine its usefulness to other customers.  Were e-commerce \n\nExamining additional product types can enable the generalization of the authors' methodology to other products.  Furthermore, the exploration of a sliding scale for search vs. experience-based products can further support generalization and business goals.  Producing a reliable scale and methods for classifying a products' degree of being experienced-based can inform vendors on:\n\n* How to best sort product reviews\n\n* Examine what are the most helpful reviews to know the performance of the product alongside customer experience and sentiment\n\n* Adjust the product, its marketing, or future production based upon market efficacy.\n\n* Understanding the emotions a customer wants to express through a review is crucial as it will affect the \"recommendation score\" of that particular product or a different one from a similar category.\n\n    * To contribute in determining this recommendation score, we can use a probabilistic machine learning algorithm like Naive Bayes to determine the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of customer reviews.\n    \n    * Typically used for amending product design, Kansei Engineering can be used to incorporate human emotional responses into evaluation of a customer review. \n  <!--AK talk about Naive Bayes, Kansei Method--> \n\n* Determine which customer is trustworthy, meaning who has actually purchased the product versus a customer who gave a false review. Based on the ‘customer reputation score’, our aim is to classify customers into groups to judge reviewer reliability. This has two main aspects:\n\n    * Star-rating score which is a discrete scale that tells the inclination of a customer.\n    \n    * Text review ‘sentiment score’ using NLP that explains customer opinions based on words.\n    <!--UK - talk about Customer Reliability methods--> \n\n## Literature Survey\n\n* **Additional commentary on original paper here**\n\n* **Paper(s) on product classification (search-experience-mixed)**\n\n* **Paper(s) on user/consumer/reviewer classification**\n<!--PC, UK, AK-->\n* **All papers you've found, provide a summary of what they did and any key results**\n\n    * Hu, W., Gong, Z., & Guo, J.

Mining Product Features from Online Reviews. 2010 IEEE 7th International Conference on E-Business Engineering. doi:10.1109/icebe.2010.51\n    \n        * The proposed system employs a two-step process for opinion mining: identifying opinion sentences using a SentiWordNet-based algorithm and extracting product features from all reviews in the database. This feature extraction function focuses on identifying commonly expressed positive or negative opinions before extracting explicit and implicit product features.\n\n    * Rajeev, P. V., & Rekha, V.
