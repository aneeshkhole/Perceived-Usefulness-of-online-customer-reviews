Having reviews from reliable sources with sufficiently detailed information can enable greater confidence in a purchase, improved customer satisfaction, and smooth the process of ecommerce for customers.\n\nWe seek to expound upon the research of *paper reference here* to explore additional recommended research areas, in the direction\n\n## What / Where\n\n*(Citation)* provided the following areas for recommended additional research at the conclusion of their paper: \n\n* Expand the number of products beyond 3 items (one search, one experience, one mixed)\n\n* Explore customer metadata for classifying reviewer types <!--Team - I don't know that we can actually go about getting customer metadata.  This may be a bridge too far for us unless the site(s) we identify can provide such information--> \n\nWe seek to explore Item #1 above and explore the possibility of assessing a scale for products to determine the extent to which they are a search-based or an experience-based product.  Having a continuous scale between 0 and 1 can potentially simplify the formulas used by the authors down to a single equation: \n\n$$\n\n$$\n\nWe seek to examine additional products and product types between multiple e-commerce websites (BestBuy, Target, Amazon)\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nFeedback from customers is beneficial, but it is not always ordered by the most informative or beneficial feedback first.  Certain features of data such as... can impact the usefulness of the feedback on a customer-by-customer basis.  Level of detail, star-rating, and number of votes that support the review as being useful to a customer can all help determine its usefulness to other customers.  Were e-commerce \n\nExamining additional product types can enable the generalization of the authors' methodology to other products.  Furthermore, the exploration of a sliding scale for search vs. experience-based products can further support generalization and business goals.  Producing a reliable scale and methods for classifying a products' degree of being experienced-based can inform vendors on:\n\n* How to best sort product reviews\n\n* Examine what are the most helpful reviews to know the performance of the product alongside customer experience and sentiment\n\n* Adjust the product, its marketing, or future production based upon market efficacy.\n\n* \n\n## Literature Survey\n\n* **Additional commentary on original paper here**\n\n* **Paper(s) on product classification (search-experience-mixed)**\n\n* **Paper(s) on user/consumer/reviewer classification**\n\n## Research Questions\n\n* Can the model from *(original paper citation)* be generalized with\n\n    a. larger volume of products and product types?\n\n    b. a sliding scale weight for degree to which a product is a \"search\" (0) or \"experience\" (1) product?\n\n* Can products be classified on degree of search or experience *(need other research that can tell us what features of a product determine what makes a product a search vs. experience product)* using:\n\n    a. Feature 1\n\n    b. Feature 2\n\n    c. Some combination of features?\n\n## Goals / Definition of Success\n\n* Replicate similar results to *(original paper citation)* with similar product types\n\n* Expound upon *(original paper citation)* with additional products, including:\n\n    a. Product 1\n\n    b. Product 2\n\n    c. Product 3\n\n    d. Verify goodness of fit of original model\n\n* Perform analysis of multiple product types to produce a weighting for degree of how experienced-based the product is.\n\n* Assess weighting of products in terms of degree of \"experience\" base, and use an updated formula on\n\n    a. Original Model\n\n    b. Updated Model\n\n    c. Extrapolation on data outside the models.\n\n* Success of our effort and this methodology is met if it produces as-good or better performance of the experience weight-based model vs. the original model from *(original paper citation here)*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where our abstract will go.\n\nHere's an example of inserting a plot directly into our paper\n\n```{python}\n#| label: fig-a\n#| fig-cap: a matplotlib plot\nx = np.linspace(-5,5)\ny = x**2\nplt.scatter(\n    x,y\n)\n```\n\nHere's an example of pulling some data in from our github repo\n\n```{python}\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\n#reference data directly that sits in the github repo\ntemp = pd.read_csv('../data/Fatalities.csv')\n\ntemp['ST'] = temp['state'].str.upper()\n\n#add the ratio column to examine the plot by ratio of alcohol fatalitites to all fatalities\ntemp['afatal_ratio'] = temp['afatal'] / temp['fatal']\n\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n#collection point for data to be held from each slider position\nslider_info = []\n\n#slice the data by year \nfor y in range(temp['year'].min(),temp['year'].max()+1):\n    #get the current year's data\n    year_data = temp[temp['year']==y]\n\n    #build a dictionary to house the data for the year\n    #we specify \"choropleth\" to feed the dictionary to plotly\n    #when we have a slider change\n    dict_year_data = {\n        'type':'choropleth',\n        'locations':year_data['ST'], #we want information by-state\n        'z':year_data['afatal_ratio'], #plot the ratio of alcohol fatalities to all fatalities.\n        'locationmode':'USA-states', #look at the US\n        'colorbar':{'title':'alcohol-related fatalities (%)'} #label the color axis\n    }\n    #collect all the data to add to our slider information\n    slider_info.append(dict_year_data)\n\nsteps = []\nfor i in range(len(slider_info)):\n    step = dict(\n        method='restyle',\n
