In our efforts, we leveraged python Selenium, urllib, and Beautiful Soup to scrape data from 20 different products across multiple websites (Amazon, BestBuy, and Target).  Where possible, we sought to collect the exact same 20 products from each site and customer feedback associated with each.\n\nAs part of collection, to the greatest extent we were able, we cleaned information *during* the scraping process.  Doing this enabled us to have minimal cleaning efforts after collection.  Post collection, remaining items such as handling and removing special characters, unicode characters, addressing customer reviews written in foreign languages, and addressing misspellings remained necessary.\n\nIn terms of simplicity for scraping our data, we manually identified a list of products from each of the aforementioned sites.  Our team divided responsibilities to produce scraping code customized for each of the three websites.\n\n## Data Collection Details\n\nIn collecting our data, in order to adhere to the model implemented by @percUse, we required the following data points: \n\n::: {#8e7f142d .cell tbl='tbl-data-reqs-products' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n</style>\n<table id=\"T_98d0d\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_98d0d_level0_col0\" class=\"col_heading level0 col0\" >Variable</th>\n      <th id=\"T_98d0d_level0_col1\" class=\"col_heading level0 col1\" >Data Type</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row0_col0\" class=\"data row0 col0\" >Product Title</td>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row0_col1\" class=\"data row0 col1\" >string</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row1_col0\" class=\"data row1 col0\" >Product Category*</td>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row1_col1\" class=\"data row1 col1\" >string</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row2_col0\" class=\"data row2 col0\" >Product Details/Specs</td>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row2_col1\" class=\"data row2 col1\" >string</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >Product Cost</td>\n      <td id=\"T_98d0d_row3_col1\" class=\"data row3 col1\" >float</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the product category variable - we may add our own manual categorization.  @percUse manually set the value for this variable.  Part of the intent of our research is to seek out means and methods to replace this variable with a continuous scale (ranging from 0 for a \"search\" good, to a 1 for an \"experience\" good).  \n\nAs an initial proxy for this variable and to operationalize it, we leverage a measure of subjectivity for the product - namely how subjective (e.g. how many adverb, adjective, and other word modifiers) are present within the details and specifications of a product.  A product that more aligns to a \"search\" product, we hypothesize, will have fewer modifying words and be oriented toward the facts of the object.  \n\nFor example, a desk has specific dimensions for length, width, and height, an associated weight, and material from which the desk is made, and possibly some warranty information - all of which are likely to be contained within the product description and specifications.  We would characterize such a good as a \"search\" good (or a 0 on our scale).  Leveraging existing language processing tools should allow us to calculate a value for subjectivity in the product's description and specifications.  \n\nInitially, we'll explore product subjectivity in the combination of the specification and the description, though it may be necessary to explore product subjectivity solely within one of these fields or the other to pursue our modeling. \n\n::: {#tbl-data-reqs-ratings .cell tbl-cap='Review Data Required' execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```{=html}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n</style>\n<table id=\"T_fab7f\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_fab7f_level0_col0\" class=\"col_heading level0 col0\" >Variable</th>\n      <th id=\"T_fab7f_level0_col1\" class=\"col_heading level0 col1\" >Data Type</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row0_col0\" class=\"data row0 col0\" >Verified Purchase</td>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row0_col1\" class=\"data row0 col1\" >boolean</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row1_col0\" class=\"data row1 col0\" >Star Rating</td>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row1_col1\" class=\"data row1 col1\" >float</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row2_col0\" class=\"data row2 col0\" >Review Content</td>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row2_col1\" class=\"data row2 col1\" >string</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >Useful Votes</td>\n      <td id=\"T_fab7f_row3_col1\" class=\"data row3 col1\" >integer</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @tbl-data-reqs-ratings, we outline the specific datapoints we sought out for reviews across each website.  @percUse leveraged star rating, review content (specifically the review length), and the number of votes for the review being useful as key measures in their research.  To further their work, we plan on exploring the impacts of verified product purchasers and the impact of verification on how useful a review may be to potential customers.\n\n::: {#tbl-data-calcs .cell tbl-cap='Additional Calculated Columns, Post Data Collection' execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```{=html}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n</style>\n<table id=\"T_63dae\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th id=\"T_63dae_level0_col0\" class=\"col_heading level0 col0\" >Variable</th>\n      <th id=\"T_63dae_level0_col1\" class=\"col_heading level0 col1\" >Data Type</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row0_col0\" class=\"data row0 col0\" >Product Subjectivity</td>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row0_col1\" class=\"data row0 col1\" >float</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row1_col0\" class=\"data row1 col0\" >Review Length (Words)</td>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row1_col1\" class=\"data row1 col1\" >integer</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row2_col0\" class=\"data row2 col0\" >Review Subjectivity</td>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row2_col1\" class=\"data row2 col1\" >float</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >Review Polarity</td>\n      <td id=\"T_63dae_row3_col1\" class=\"data row3 col1\" >float</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPost collection, we added the calculations listed in @tbl-data-calcs to our review data and product data (less reputation score).  Each of these calculations will allow us to better understand our underlying data and explore possibilities of where and how each may fit into models for review usefulness.\n\nWe have also established a master listing of all products for which we collected data and have associated arbitrary identifiers with the products.  In instances where we've successfully pulled data for *identical* products from multiple websites, it can allow us to explore the impact on product and review metrics and investigate the listing site as a treatment variable. \n\nFor instance - exploring the impact of review subjectivity, polarity, length, and usefulness, based upon which site the product was listed.\n\n## Data Exploration\n\nAfter collection and cleaning, we plan to explore our data via visualization, seeking to answer key research questions.\n\n* Is the price of a product higher, given it's offered on Amazon, BestBuy, or Target? <!--Eliminate?-->\n\n* Is a product's star rating affected by which e-commerce platform is selling it?\n\n* Is there a substantial difference in number of product reviews on one e-commerce platform vs. another?\n\n* Is one e-commerce platform more likely to have input and feedback on reviews (i.e. higher proportion of \"this review is helpful\" votes to total number of reviews)? <!--Eliminate?-->\n\n* What is the difference in the level of detail provided in product descriptions (e.g. for the same product) across each e-commerce platform?  \n\n* Do certain product categories perform better on specific platforms? <!--Eliminate?-->\n\n* Are users more likely to leave reviews on one platform over another?\n\n* Do customers show different purchasing behaviors based on promotional strategies employed by platforms?\n\nStructuring our data properly during the collection process will enable us to explore and answer these questions.\n\n## Collection Procedures?\n\nWe wrote code to allow us to gather information from each website.  The general process for each e-commerce platform is similar.  To alleviate any unnecessary burden for any of these websites, we manually identified URLs to the specific products we sought out to gather, and wrote our code to iterate through those URLs and pull the necessary data and features we sought.  This manual identification also allowed us to ensure, in most cases, that we were getting the *exact* same product during data capture.  This hybrid approach enabled higher certainty in getting the same product while also accelerating collection, structuring, and cleaning of product review information.\n\n* Gathering from Amazon (All Products)\n\n    * Product & Review data was scraped from Amazon's website using Python and Selenium. A Selenium WebDriver was utilized to automate web browser interactions. After navigating to product categories like electronics, home appliances, furniture, books, and grocery, Selenium's functions were employed to locate review elements. These elements were then parsed and collected, storing the data in a structured format i.e. a CSV file. Pagination handling was implemented to scrape reviews from multiple pages. \n\n* Gathering from BestBuy (Electronic Products, Furniture Item(s)? - no grocery or clothing)\n\n    * Just like Target and Amazon, even BestBuy has dynamic content on its web page. We employed Python with Selenium to automate the exploration of product pages, unveiling hidden content, and harvesting essential data. Employing Selenium's functionalities, we initiated the traversal process, enabling the program to automatically expand pertinent sections to uncover additional information. By targeting elements such as product details and reviews, we orchestrated the seamless extraction of critical fields from each product's page. This automated approach allowed us to efficiently parse through an extensive array of reviews, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of user feedback for the products under scrutiny. We systematically stored the extracted data in our records tables for further analysis and reference.\n\n* Gathering from Target (All products)\n\n    * Target has dynamic content on their webpages.  We used Python Selenium to navigate to product pages and automate the selection of items needed to expand sections to reveal additional data.  We also automated the process of expanding out all reviews so as to iterate through and parse the content of every review for each product in question. \n\n## Data Exploration and Visualization\n\nFor our data exploration, we plan to examine solely the reviews for which we have data from all of our websites.  Due to the nature of the vendors, not all offer the same products online.  We've included some unique products from each site (and may even gather more), but will exclude them from initial analysis. \n\nThe reason for only examining common products is to check for comparability and similarity of the products associated variables (e.g. product subjectivity, review subjectivity, review polarity, star rating, and so forth) between the websites.  If they are similar or comparable, it may mean that we could use single models to make predictions on the usefulness of customer feedback.  If they are substantially dissimilar, it may mean that modifiers are needed based upon the e-commerce platform in which the product is listed.\n\nWe'll start by looking at distributions of some of these key variables, and check some of the common trends between them, potentially moving on to hypothesis testing of these variables to check for statistically significant differences.\n\n### Univariate Plots and Distributions\n\n::: {#cell-fig-hist-plots .cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Histogram Plot (star-rating, by-site)](data_files/figure-html/fig-hist-plots-output-1.png){#fig-hist-plots width=662 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExamining the histogram plots for star-rating by website, we can see that, generally, reviews tend to provide positive feedback for the selected products.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-qq-plots-subj .cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Q-Q plots (star-rating, by-site)](data_files/figure-html/fig-qq-plots-subj-output-1.png){#fig-qq-plots-subj width=587 height=477}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAcross all three websites, there appears to be consistency with adherence to, and issues with, the normal distribution for subjectivity.  These charts suggest sufficient normal distribution of review subjectivity (degree of inclusion of word modifiers such as adverbs and adjectives).  \n\nTherre seems to be slight skewness in the tails of these Q-Q distributions.  Filtering off some of the outliers may grant us reasonable relevance and assurance to perform hypothesis testing and evaluation of these variables across sites (e.g. ANOVA, F-Testing, etc)\n\n::: {#fig-qq-plots-pol .cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Q-Q plots (star-rating, by-site)](data_files/figure-html/fig-qq-plots-pol-output-1.png){#fig-qq-plots-pol-1 width=581 height=416}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](data_files/figure-html/fig-qq-plots-pol-output-2.png){#fig-qq-plots-pol-2 width=587 height=477}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilar to review subjectivity, review polarity has good adherence to the normal distribution (particularly on the quantile interval of \\[-2,2\\]).  There are similar issues in the tails of these distributions as exist for review subjectivity.  As such, reduction in outliers may enable us to perform hypothesis testing during our model design and implementation.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-helpful-vote-dist .cell execution_count=9}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of Review Helpful Votes](data_files/figure-html/fig-helpful-vote-dist-output-1.png){#fig-helpful-vote-dist width=662 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-rand-exp-dist .cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Random Exponential Distributions with Means by Site](data_files/figure-html/fig-rand-exp-dist-output-1.png){#fig-rand-exp-dist width=662 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExamining the plots of @fig-helpful-vote-dist and @fig-rand-exp-dist, the distribution of helpful votes, per website, appears to be exponentially distributed, with many reviews having an expected total count of helpful votes centered fairly low.  Namely, for amazon, the expected value is approximately 3.69 helpful votes, for Target 0.18 helpful votes, and BestBuy with 0.15 helpful votes.  \n\nKnowing the distribution of these predictions will assist us in the modeling process and may require us to perform variable transformations (e.g. if we pursue a multiple linear regression model).\n\n::: {#cell-fig-outliers-star-rating .cell execution_count=11}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Outliers for Review Star Rating](data_files/figure-html/fig-outliers-star-rating-output-1.png){#fig-outliers-star-rating width=854 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-outliers-polarity .cell execution_count=12}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Outliers for Review Polarity](data_files/figure-html/fig-outliers-polarity-output-1.png){#fig-outliers-polarity width=854 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-outliers-subjectivity .cell execution_count=13}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Outliers for Review Subjectivity](data_files/figure-html/fig-outliers-subjectivity-output-1.png){#fig-outliers-subjectivity width=854 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n    * Violin Plots\n\n* Bar Plots \n\n### Bi/Multivariate Plots\n\n::: {#cell-fig-bivar-plot .cell execution_count=14}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Bivariate Plot for Sensitivity and Polarity, by Site](data_files/figure-html/fig-bivar-plot-output-1.png){#fig-bivar-plot width=854 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n    * Box Plots\n\n::: {#cell-fig-violin-plots1 .cell execution_count=16}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Violin Plots of Review Star-Rating vs. Subjectivity, by Site](data_files/figure-html/fig-violin-plots1-output-1.png){#fig-violin-plots1 width=851 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-violin-plots2 .cell execution_count=17}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Violin Plots for Star Rating vs. Polarity, by Site](data_files/figure-html/fig-violin-plots2-output-1.png){#fig-violin-plots2 width=854 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGenerally, in @fig-violin-plots1 and @fig-violin-plots2, we see a trend for the median polarity and subjectivity of each review to increase as the star rating increases.  We also see that, generally, the data suggest that we have a minimum of neutral polarity that tends towards positive as star rating increases.\n\nSince both median subjectivity and polarity seem to increase with respect to star rating, such a correlation could be useful to us in multiple linear regression, and is generally useful to us for consideration when pursuing model development.\n\n### Hypothesis Testing for Key Feature and Response Variables\n\nSome key features we plan to explore in our modeling include review subjectivity and review polarity.  Knowing whether or not there is a significant difference for these features between the websites on which they're hosted will inform us during model selection, design, and implementation.  As such, we'll perform ANOVA and Tukey Honest Significant Difference Tests on these variables between each site.\n\n\n#### ANOVA Testing\n\n\n#### Tukey Tests with E-Commerce Platform as Treatment\n\n::: {#cell-fig-tukey-tests .cell execution_count=18}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Tukey Tests for Star Rating, Polarity, and Subjectivity, by-Site](data_files/figure-html/fig-tukey-tests-output-1.png){#fig-tukey-tests width=950 height=566}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Tukey honest significance tests, depicted in @fig-tukey-tests suggest some interesting patterns between the three websites.  Namely, target and best buy seem to have (across the board) higher star ratings, polarity, and subjectivity than the same variables for Amazon!  Additionally, for each variable and each website, it seems there is no overlap in the variables at the 95% confidence level.  The only exception here is for subjectivity between Target and BestBuy holding no statistically significant difference.  \n\n\n\n### Exploring Sentiments - Star Rating vs. Sentiment Variables\n\n* Inter-Website Comparison of Product Reviews\n\n    * Same Product \n\n        * Clustering? \n\n        * Distances?\n\n    * All Products\n\n    * Inspect the following, visually: \n    \n        * Product Ratings\n        \n        * Customer Sentiments **try to score before plotting & turn-in**\n        \n        * Review Polarity **try to score and store before plotting**\n        \n        * Naive Bayes Classifier\n        \n        * Reliability estimates\n\n        * Product description subjectivity scores **try to score and store before turn-in** \n        \n        * Average / Spread of number of ratings per product, **try to score and store before turn-in** \n        \n        * Average/Spread of Useful Votes per Product Review, **try to score and store before turn-in** \n        \n        * Inspection of Data and / or Scoring using Kansei method.\n\n* Will need to take note on if / how these variables conform to some form of statistical distribution (uniform, normal, exponential, etc)\n\n## Data Before / After\n\nMuch of our data cleaning occured during the collection process.  Our team took specific steps to pursue cleaning during collection to simplify the process of bringing all information together:\n\n* Using regular expressions to extract key values from text blocks\n\n* Leveraging XPATH, class names, and element IDs to identify HTML fields in which our desired data points resided\n\nPost-scraping, we had to pursue some additional cleanup\n\n* Removal of unicode characters from review content where possible through coding and scripting.\n\n* Conversion of numbers, stored as strings, to integers (i.e. star ratings, cost/dollar amounts)\n\n* Handling of missing values (i.e. no ratings, no star ratings, no cost listed)\n\nA particular challenge we came across during the data cleaning process was the handling foreign language reviews, highly repetitive reviews, and misspelled reviews.  To better support our calculated measures for subjectivity and polarity, we leveraged the langdetect library to attempt to classify the languages of each of our 45,000+ reviews collected.\n\n::: {#tbl-foreign-lang-reviews .cell tbl-cap='Examples of reviews written in foreign languages' execution_count=20}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=20}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>site</th>\n      <th>reviewer_name</th>\n      <th>review_content</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>11</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Moldea muy bien, me gustó mucho!

In our data exploration, we found that many of these false positives were outliers in other categories (whether for review length, review subjectivity, review polarity, or star rating).  As such, we find it prudent to exclude these reviews from our dataset when pursuing model development.  \n\nIn total, langdetect classified fewer than 440 reviews (accounting for less than 1% of our collected reviews) as being non-English, or being repeated words or gibberish.  Excluding these reviews should have minimal impact on the pursuit of model development.\n\nTextBlob also offers us the ability to attempt to correct the spelling of reviews.  Due to the amount of time it would take us to pursue spelling corre\n\nHere are some additional examples of gibberish or non-contributional text that impact calculations for review subjectivity and polarity.  While some of these could potentially provide value with deeper analysis, we find that these will not contribute significantly to our research.\n\n::: {#fe170493 .cell execution_count=21}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=21}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>site</th>\n      <th>reviewer_name</th>\n      <th>review_content</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>962</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Kiran Kumar</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>980</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Ervey Gomez</td>\n      <td>'s  s  s    s   !    s s    s !</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1907</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Kathya De Alvarenga</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2691</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Cristopher Leyva</td>\n      <td>10/10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2892</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Amazon Customer</td>\n      <td>10/10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2997</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>Joe Zuppardo</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3567</th>\n      <td>Amazon</td>\n      <td>HAMZAH ALGHAMDI</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>21293</th>\n      <td>BestBuy</td>\n      <td>Andy</td>\n      <td>: )          : )          : )          : )    ...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>23207</th>\n      <td>BestBuy</td>\n      <td>Andy</td>\n      <td>: )          : )          : )          : )    ...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe are retaining the totality of the data we've collected, and will filter the data based upon our findings here so as to keep the most relevant and supportive data in building our models.\n\n## Insights from Collection and EDA \n\n* Statistically significant differences for review subjectivity, polarity across each of the three websites.\n\n* Exclusion of outliers for one or more categories could result in excluding lower star rating reviews, which could impact model\n\n<!-- ```{r TryBothOnePaper}\nprint(\"Hello,world!\")\n``` -->\n\n",
