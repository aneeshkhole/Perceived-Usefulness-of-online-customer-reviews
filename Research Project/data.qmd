Here's our data section.

## Some items to research

## Collection
In collecting our data, in order to adhere to the model implemented by *(original paper here)*, we require the following data points, at a minimum:

```{python dataReqs}
#|tbl: tbl-data-reqs
data_reqs = {
    'Variable':['Star Rating', 'Review Content', 'Useful Votes'],
    'Data Type':['float','string','integer']
}
tbl_data_reqs = pd.DataFrame(data_reqs)
tbl_data_reqs.set_index('Variable')
tbl_data_reqs.style.hide(axis='index')
```

To classify products...we need metadata of the product itself.  We are seeking to use the following products, and for each, we'll collect the following data:

* Original Products: (update to table later)

    * Video Games (rating I.e. pg, pg-13, R, but from MSRB ratings).

    * Digital/Physical Music (duration, music style / genre, others?)

    * Grocery Products (calories per serving, special markers [gluten-free, fat-free, vegan], )  - *potential hypothesis that grocery products with special markings may be more experience-based than search-based.*

Additional Products

* Clothing - likely a mixed product, potentially ranging from search-based for plain t-shirts to experience-based for high fashion products

    * material?

* Laptops / Computers 

    * Likely a mix between search and experience

    * RAM, CPU, Storage, OS Included, Graphics Type, ...

* Something else?

## Preparation, Standardization, and Cleaning

* Gathering from Amazon (All Products)

* Gathering from BestBuy (Electronic Products, no grocery or clothing)

* Gathering from Target (All products)

## Visualization
