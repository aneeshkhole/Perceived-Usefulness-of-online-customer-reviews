Here's our data section.

## Some items to research

## Collection
In collecting our data, in order to adhere to the model implemented by *(original paper here)*, we require the following data points, at a minimum:

```{python dataReqs}
#|tbl: tbl-data-reqs
data_reqs = {
    'Variable':['Product Title','Product Category*','Product Details/Specs', 'Verified Purchase', 'Star Rating', 'Review Content', 'Useful Votes'],
    'Data Type':['string','string','string','boolean','float','string','integer']
}
tbl_data_reqs = pd.DataFrame(data_reqs)
tbl_data_reqs.set_index('Variable')
tbl_data_reqs.style.hide(axis='index')
```

```{python dataCalcs}
#|tbl: tbl-data-calcs
data_calcs = {
    'Variable':['Review Length', 'Sentiment Score','Reputation Score','Product Type Score','Polarity Score'],
    'Data Type':['integer','float','float','float','float']
}
tbl_data_calcs  = pd.DataFrame(data_calcs)
tbl_data_calcs.set_index('Variable')
tbl_data_calcs.style.hide(axis='index')
```

To classify products...we need metadata of the product itself.  We are seeking to use the following products, and for each, we'll collect the following data:

* Original Products: (update to table later)

    * Video Games (rating I.e. pg, pg-13, R, but from MSRB ratings).

    * Digital/Physical Music (duration, music style / genre, others?)

    * Grocery Products (calories per serving, special markers [gluten-free, fat-free, vegan], )  - *potential hypothesis that grocery products with special markings may be more experience-based than search-based.*

<!-- 

    a. Original products from (paper): Digital Music, Video Game, and Grocery Item

    b. Additional products (Amazon and Target): Furniture Items, Clothing Items, Home Appliances, Books, Cosmetics, Cleaning supplies

    c. Additional Proucts (Amazon, Target, BestBuy): Electronics

    d. Verify goodness of fit of original model

-->

Additional Products

* Clothing - likely a mixed product, potentially ranging from search-based for plain t-shirts to experience-based for high fashion products

    * material?

## Preparation, Standardization, and Cleaning

* Gathering from Amazon (All Products)

* Gathering from BestBuy (Electronic Products, no grocery or clothing)

* Gathering from Target (All products)
