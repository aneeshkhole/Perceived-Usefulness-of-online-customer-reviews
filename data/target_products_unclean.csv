Super-steady Video

Video you capture is effortlessly smooth, thanks to Auto Focus Video Stabilization. Now, your nature shots, dance videos and laughable moments will be clear, steady and unforgettable. 1

Nightography

Some of the best times happen when the sun’s down. Nightography lets you snap or record every single moment clearly — anytime, anywhere, regardless of light. Night Mode has you covered.

Skip the glamour shots. With Portrait Mode, your favorite faces (even your pet’s) never looked better. Keep your subject in the spotlight with up to 3x the optical zoom, enhanced image processing and intuitive features. So when the light hits just right, you can start a pro photoshoot on the spot, no matter the distance between you and your subject.

Adaptive Color Contrast

Streaming on the go, working from your patio or binge-watching late into the night? An adaptive screen on Galaxy S22 automatically optimizes color and brightness, indoors and outdoors. No matter what route your day takes, it’s always a scenic one.

Description
The story of Cal Kestis continues in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor™, a third person galaxy-spanning action-adventure game from Respawn Entertainment, developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. This narratively-driven, single player title picks up five years after the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order™ and follows Cal’s increasingly desperate fight as the galaxy descends further into darkness. Pushed to the edges of the galaxy by the Empire, Cal will find himself surrounded by threats new and familiar. As one of the last surviving Jedi Knights, Cal is driven to make a stand during the galaxy’s darkest times - but how far is he willing to go to protect himself, his crew, and the legacy of the Jedi Order?
To survive, players will build upon Cal’s training with an expanded list of iconic Force abilities, combat stances, and lightsaber customizations that can be combined in new and different ways to fight as a Jedi. While the Force is a powerful ally, it may not be enough. Cal will have to get creative and master new abilities, tactics and even leverage the environment around him to overcome the obstacles ahead.
Fans of Star Wars™ will travel to new planets and familiar frontiers as Cal seeks to reunite the crew of the Stinger Mantis. New Force abilities, equipment and upgrades will enable players to search, explore, and re-traverse in new ways across multiple planets, each with their own unique challenges to face. The Galaxy is full of stories, secrets, and treasures to uncover for those willing to face the dangers that lay off the beaten path.
