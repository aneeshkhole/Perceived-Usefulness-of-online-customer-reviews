0,8930,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,List of Changes (Compared to the Wii U version),Vincent,"This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:

1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original

2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl)

3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item

4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth

5. ""Smart Steering"" A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.

6. ""Auto-accelerate"" for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral

7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup

8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against

9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on

10. Online Play.
-Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the ""Y"" button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.

- You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early

-When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match

- More icon packs for tournament mode

11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen

12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo

13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game

14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages

15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc)

16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match

17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:

-Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.

-Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell

-Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs

-Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out

-Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it

==Additional notes:
- There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps

-There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players

-Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse

-No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down

-No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo

-Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced

-Other balance changes:
Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.

Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on

If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked.

Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shell

Easier to break while drifting (advanced tactic)

-Luigi still has his signature death stare

If there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.

Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",5,0,0.9999943509333423
1,10975,Target,Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum,499.99,"The good, the bad, and the questionable.",Just Some Guy,"Our last vacuum was a DC-07. Used it for 18 years. It was a great vacuum overall, and would still be going strong today, but my wife needs something easier to handle due to her bad back. She narrowed her choices down to two vacuums: the Ball Animal 3, and a competitor's. Obviously, given our positive experience with the DC-07, we went with the Dyson, and also because the competitor's model still uses bags (seriously?) which we didn't want to deal with. In terms of engineering, the Ball Animal 3 is impressive. The suction is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's so powerful that in some cases--like bathroom rugs, hallway runners, etc--it's actually a detriment because the rug buckles as you're pulling the vacuum back. My wife likes the head design; it's lower to the ground so it can get into tighter spaces under chairs, etc. I also like that you can see the brush bar while operating the vacuum, so you know whether it's spinning or needs to be cleaned. So as far as engineering and technology are concerned, the Ball Animal 3 is fantastic. The vacuum's Achille's heal, however, is its ergonomics. This is not an easy vacuum to use, and requires a fair amount of strength to push around. I'm 6'3"" 250+ lbs, and by the time I'm finished vacuuming with the Ball Animal 3, my shoulder feels like it's going to fall off, and my back hurts for about a half hour afterwards, from the coccyx up to the middle. If *I'm* this stiff, sore, sweating like a pig, and gasping for air after using the vacuum, imagine what it must be like for my poor wife and her bad back! This vacuum does not ""roll"" or ""glide"" across the carpet, and frankly I also feel it's a lot harder to maneuver. On a positive note, though, the clutch mechanism is in a much more user-friendly location now (an electronic switch next to the power button versus having to bend over and manipulate a mechanical knob); but then Dyson goes and cancels it out by putting the suction adjustment slider in an even more inconvenient location than where the DC-07 clutch knob was. My wife likes the wand on this unit better than the DC-07. I disagree, but I do like that the tools can be directly attached to the hose now. That's probably the best improvement Dyson made, ergonomically speaking. Unfortunately, the main chassis/body still ""follows"" you around whenever you stretch the hose, getting in the way and making the job harder. The on-board storage of the tools isn't very good, either, and seems like it was more of an afterthought. The brush bar is much easier to remove on the Ball Animal 3. It's more of a sleeve that fits over the actual rotating mechanism, so no special tool is required to disconnect the drive belt from the roller bar. Lastly, both filters on the Ball Animal 3 are washable (the post-motor filter on the DC-07 wasn't washable and had to be replaced periodically, and was difficult to access). Now as for the construction of the Ball Animal 3, that remains in question. Some of the plastic, particularly in the handle and the flip-up wand end cap, is really flimsy and bends way too much. I feel like it's going to snap or permanently deform at any moment. However, being open-minded, perhaps the flexibiltiy helps _prevent_ the plastic from snapping. I don't know. Time will tell. I'm torn. On the one hand, I want the Ball Animal 3 to give us 18+ years of reliable service like the DC-07 did; but on the other hand, I am not looking forward to my wife and I (especially her) having to lug this thing around while using it. We may be back in the market sooner than later.",3,0,0.9991015746856129
2,146,amazon,"HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color inkjet-printer, Print, scan, copy, Easy setup, Mobile printing, Best-for home, Instant Ink with HP+,white",49.89,Nope. Don't do it.,Kimberly,"I was excited to find an affordable printer for my small business that seemed to fit the needs I have.
That excitement was short lived however.
It is about the most frustrating piece of equipment I've ever dealt with. The days of a printer that just PRINTS are apparently in the rear view mirror, everything with this thing was a hassle.
Set up, connecting to WiFi, connecting to laptop- you basically HAVE to use HPs ridiculous, slow, and glitchy app in order for it to ""work"".

This printer is(was) an absolute trash bag NIGHTMARE.
It worked fine about half the time, but required constant fussing with even then.
The other half the time it just didn't. :(
No reason given, just an error as I'm frantically trying to print labels to mail my products out.
Connected to WiFi, connected to phone/computer, it just says ""naaaaah"".
Guessing it has to do with the sleep mode that you can't turn off, but who knows? (Side note- who wants a dang sleep mode?! I don't care of it uses a little power to work when I want, sheesh!)

The instant ink subscription seems like a good deal at first, until you realize you're paying by pages you actually print, NOT for the ink.
After about the 100th time of me spending 45 mins trying to print a UPS label and not being able to for exactly zero reason, this piece of crap found out the hard way.
I quietly and calmly unplugged it, carried it gently out on the front porch of my store, and hulk smashed it down the solid stone steps into the parking lot. More glass in there than I thought. 

Hate to have wasted money, but it felt pretty good to office space this worthless piece of trash. I low-key wish I could put it back together so I could smash it again, I HATE THIS THING!
H A T E H A T E H A T E H A T E H A T E H A T E
I'll never, EVER, buy another HP product.
Not a printer, not a laptop, not even a pack of paper. I hope all the bad things of the world happen to whoever invented this particular piece of crap. Stub your toe forever, lose your wallet, your keys, have diarrhea. Blegh
I'm still so angry I'm vibrating, and now I get to go buy another printer so I can send out my clients purchases. Yay.",1,0,0.994655364549391

4,9842,amazon,Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum Cleaner,399.0,It broke the first time I used it and burned my foot.,raincitykitty,"I purchased this item from a big box store and not Amazon. I'm leaving a review here because I hope others will see it. My old Animal Complete died this morning after 13 years of use. I decided to replace it with this one. What a major mistake.

As others have mentioned, it's hard to get the vacuum head to stay attached. It fell off twice after I heard it click into place. The handle and tools are considerably more flimsy than they were on my old Dyson and the vacuum head is smaller. The dirt cup seems smaller, too.

After using it for about 5 minutes, I smelled burning plastic. When I took a step forward to take a look at it, I stepped on a chunk of molten blue plastic on my carpet. The red brush strip had come off the roller (ripped off somehow, because blue strips from the roller were present as well) and wrapped around the axle of the vacuum head rendering it completely frozen and unable to rotate.

The only positive thing that I can say about it is that for the few minutes it did work without spewing molten plastic, it worked really well for both dirt and pet hair even on places I thought were already clean.

I returned it. Even if the issue with the roller brushes was a defect (and I haven't seen anyone else mention it), the cheap look and feel of this is much different from my old Animal Complete and I'll probably go with another brand.",1,0,0.9758213774098244
5,10513,amazon,"LEYAOYAO Cube Bookshelf 3 Tier Mid-Century Rustic Brown Modern Bookcase with Legs,Retro Wood Bookshelves Storage Organizer Shelf,Freestanding Open Book Shelves for Bedroom,Living Room,Office",99.98,Its a NO for me,nancheee,"Everything about this product was simply awful. The boxing came ripped yet put together by tape and you could see Styrofoam pieces coming through the cracks. I know that boxes can get damaged due to traveling in the trucks, so I assumed thats the reason the box looked that way. The box even had a sticker that was marked heavy but it did not feel heavy at all. I go to open it to start putting it together and the Styrofoam gets all over the place... Its all over each piece, all over my living room, and all over my clothes. I start taking out pieces and I knew right away that a lot of the shelving pieces were missing, and they were.
Im surprised that this item has such good reviews, because it does look nice, but I feel like it is still cheap quality. I did not see anyone else note that the legs that support the complete shelving unit are made of plastic. I think whatever you place on these shelves need to be very lightweight like picture frames and maybe a vase or two Small weightless items. I was planning to put Toys, books, puzzles for my daughter and I dont feel that this shelving unit would support the weight of those items.
I obviously had to return it, but if I give any kind of suggestion to anyone thinking of buying this shelf, it is to think about what it is youre going to be putting on the shelves to make sure that they are lightweight enough and to take into consideration the legs are plastic- you could probably not attach them if youd like.. but thats one of the high quality-looking features. If I wanted a simple, cheap shelf, I would just buy one at target for half the price.",2,0,0.971854456580913
6,10885,amazon,"Best Choice Products Upholstered Sectional Sofa for Home, Apartment, Dorm, Bonus Room, Compact Spaces w/Chaise Lounge, 3-Seat, L-Shape Design, Reversible Ottoman Bench, 680lb Capacity - Blue/Gray",359.99,Utter Garbage,Berto,"Wow. I really dont know where to begin. The holes dont line up, the construction is remarkably shoddy, the parts are uneven and dont fit together properly. The feet dont sit flush against the bottom of the couch, theres a 4mm gap on one half of the center feet, so its only a matter of time until it fails.
Its also super uncomfortable. The smaller cushions are less dense foam than the large cushion, and slightly different thicknesses. The back is also much shorter than it looks, which means sitting in it is awkward.
You also cant return it without paying $75, and its impossible to get back into the box anyway since all the cushions are vacuum sealed and they triple in size once opened.
Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This couch will make you very sad.
UPDATE: its been nine months, and it just gets worse. The center of the couch is collapsing, the cushion foam is deteriorating, and when my girlfriend and I sit on the couch together, we shock each other with static electricity whenever one of us moves.
My roommates are like well, I guess thats what we get for $200. Except it was $420.

8,314,amazon,"TurboTax Basic 2023 Tax Software, Federal Tax Return [PC/Mac Download]",39.99,Turbo Tax is a great tax program but.......,Amazon Customer,"First off I've been using Turbo Tax disc version since 2012 and love the simplicity of doing complex taxes in a relatively short time. Since the first time I installed Turbo Tax using physical discs, I've had zero problems until this 2023 tax version. My PC is running Windows 10 and just like everytime before I install software, I make sure Windows is updated. Upon startup of the install disc two error messages appeared stating two dll files were missing for necessary installation. Upon investigation I found that the files belonged to Microsoft visual c++ which is a program used by Turbo Tax during creating it and is also part of the Windows system. The problem apparently was that my freshly updated Windows 10 didn't have the same version of Windows Virtual C++ that the 2023 Turbo Tax required. So after an hour or so of searching the internet I found and downloaded three versions of the missing files because the required one was unknown to me. After trying each one, one by one, I finally stumbled on the correct version and Turbo Tax took off and Installed. Besides this being extremely annoying, the whole process was ridiculous for something that should have all the necessary files on the disc for a normal installation. The disc package states it's for Windows 10. Shouldn't have to search the internet for required files especially since I've been running Turbo Tax on the same PC for years.",3,0,0.9596159090471997

I do not ask for the $100 in gas and time for two days travel because they sent damaged product twice, but did expect them refund the repackaged gift fee that they were making right but they have not and are ignoring any contact!

Igloo coolers, by far, has the worst customer service on the planet. The products I received were either inferior or damaged.

13,9225,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,"Too Easy, too busy, too chaotic",Bob,"After playing Mario Kart Wii for years and years and enjoying the challenge of unlocking courses and characters and karts, I was looking forward to the new version of the game on the Nintendo Switch (we skipped the Wii U). Kind of disappointed. There's seemingly little challengs, and most everything (tracks, characters, courses) is available right off the bat. You don't even have to push the 'gas pedal' anymore! You can literally set the control down and finish the race by letting it drive itself, and you may even finish in a good position. They tried too hard with the tracks to make them 'exciting'...instead some of them are just garish and chaotic and dizzying. MORE MORE MORE doesn't always mean a better game, and that's what happened here. It seems aimed at 5 year olds who always want to be a winner. If nothing else they should have put in more controls over the game parameters to make it even a little more challenging like the old Wii version which was vastly superior. If you want the numb sugar coated version, set it to that. If you want a game with a little challenge, set it to old school rules. If you loved Mario Kart Wii, this game will probably disappoint you and seem way to easy. If you never played that version before, then this one will proably just fine for you.",2,0,0.9381829434999337

I really have a hard time believing that any 12 year old could ride and enjoy this-but you never know.The bike is just like it says-it is pretty sturdy and came as amazon said it would. The one and only drawback is the charge time for the one ride. The thing has to be charged for 8 hours for only 35 minutes of ride time. The ratio is a little off. By the time my son rides it in the morning, he has to charge it so long that the play day is gone. I saw that one guy charges his for only five hours-so I guess we will play around and see how much ride time we can get for a shorter time.Overall-if the ride time was longer this would be a pretty great bike. For the short 35 minutes he rides it, he LOVES it. We have only had it since Christmas, so I don't know about the other issues people say they are having with the tires, brakes and chains-to be honest, this was to see if our son could actually handle a real bike by next year.I don't highly reccommend it because of the short ride time/long charge time issue.

I (gullibly) didnt realize until after unpacking both boxes that the pieces were different colors. Living in NYC, I dragged this up five flights of stairs myself. After unpacking, theres no realistic way to fit the pieces back into the box it came in.

Its just pretty frustrating that I payed extra for a particular color, and even worse for the mix up of the boxes.

I dislike that it stalls out printing and takes nearly 3 hours (with stops and starts and refreshing the job and canceling and reprinting) to actually print my documents and you have about 30 pages in black and white of printing before the ink runs out completely. I should have looked before I bought to note that it cannot print doublesided, and the gravity feed for the paper gets jammed easily and can only hold about 25 pages at a time. I used it for the first time today and could not complete my printing jobs because I have no more ink (it was literally making printing sounds and the pages were coming out completely blank.

I didn't keep the box because I foolishly thought this printer would be a viable option, or else I'd return it.",2,0,0.9214951509588359

We used a traditional kitchen oven to create our pizzas, and while that was bearable, we were looking for an upgrade to our pizza game. This Ninja Woodfire Oven is quite literally my favorite pickup of the year so far. There's no way to really describe how different it makes them other than you'd have to see it for yourself. Temps go up to 700 F which is insanely hot for a consumer electric oven, cooks evenly and quickly, and brings our homemade foods like our pizzas to the next level. I attached a couple images with my review, the pictures of the pizza were first attempts at using the oven on the Neapolitan setting. They came out beautifully, and they tasted like they came from a restaurant. Getting the oven up to temperature doesn't take long at all, and it only takes a couple minutes to cook your pizza, no turns needed. We like our pizzas just a bit on the burnt side, so we left ours in for another minute (after 3 minutes), and made a great ""coal-fired"" style similar to what you would find at a pizza shop that uses extremely hot ovens. There's a variety of modes for any type of food that you'd want to cook, and also an area to add wood pellets to add a ""smoky"" flavor to whatever you want. We have been using this oven for the past week with no complaints or flaws that come in our way. It's very simple to use, comes with potential recipies to use with it, works and operates how you think it should, and is easy to move, so going to a friend's house for a backyard cook, or for storage, is easy to do. We plan on getting the stand and cover that's for purchase so we can keep it outside instead of bringing it in every time. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and very happy with this oven, and it brought my pizza-making skills to the next level with no effort.",5,0,0.9177598414779383

It is easy to navigate and allows both guided assistance or direct entry onto the requisite forms. If you've used the program in the previous year, much of the personal data will be transferred automatically, a great time-saver. Being guided through the income and deduction sections prevents you from missing something that the IRS won't, especially income. Each possible source of income (or deductions) is listed and that will help you find items you might have otherwise missed. The Review section picks up any errors and allows you to make the necessary corrections and estimates your Audit risk. Filing electronically is generally easy (last year there was a problem with verifying my on-line ""signature"" (based on preceding year's data, passcode, etc.) This year was a snap and both state (extra $20) and Federal refunds were quickly obtained.

For some reason, when I opened up the program to continue my tax return, there were now TWO returns showing, both IDENTICALLY named. I had to carefully examine the contents of each to determine which one to delete (the illegitimate one). I had to delete the file through a windows interface, as I couldn't see any way to delete it using TT's menu. After doing this, THREE files showed up. I gave up on this. I never e-file my state return, as they charge for it, and I refuse to pay for something that makes their job easier. TurboTax never gave me the option to print out my state return with only the required forms; instead, I could only print out the return using the records printing interface. Because of this, I'm sure I'm including worksheet(s) that aren't required for the ""return only."" And then, the state return printed out had pages related to e-filing, as if I'd e-filed this return. The cost of a state module should include all of the state forms that may be required, not just a few of the major ones. To have to obtain a separate form for calculating energy saving improvements like solar in this day and age is ridiculous. TurboTax should have them already, not something I have to print out, fill out by hand, and attach to my return.

All the great aspects of the classic MARIO Kart games have been preserved. The battles, the races, the ability to edge out your opponents with banana peels, turtle shells or a good old fashioned side swipe.

As parents, we enjoy battling each other in some good, healthy competition. Oh, I should mention the graphics look great on our tv, too!

My only complaint is more to do with the game system than the game. Initially we played the game with a pro controller and the joy con L/R controllers locked into its base to make it work like a pro. The left joy con kept shorting out like it was having an interference problem. We had to ditch the pro controller and each use one of the tiny Joy Cons (I used the left and husband used the right). It fixed the issue, but they are so tiny they aren't as fun to hold like that. However, I have noticed the L joy com joy stick act a little funny with other games, so I'm not docking a star as it may be more of a Switch issue. I have read about other Switch owners having a similar problem. My advice - if you can afford the pro controllers at the hefty $69.99 a piece price tag, buy two of those to play this game.",5,0,0.901536040252911

One of the big reasons I ordered this is for pizza. Its awesome for parties and large dinners. After a ~25 minute pre-heat, you can crank out one after another in just 4-5 minutes each. There are pre-sets for different types of crust. I went with the thin setting and did my usual pizza recipeWow, this really makes the same old pizza MUCH better. The crust was much more airy and I love browning of the cheese. And it was amazing how easy it was to get that result on the first use at the pre-set time and temp.

And theres so much more it can do. The great thing about these Woodfire products is that they can impart a ton of smoke flavor with just a handful of pellets. Ive done jerky, pulled pork and a brisket flat. All taste and look like they came out of a Traeger! Look at that bark!!! And so easy too.

I only wish this had a viewing window in the door. Otherwise its the perfect product. Compact enough to be somewhat mobile (although heavy) and great for a small patio or balcony. But still big enough to handle 12 pies, brisket flats, and decent sized birds. Ninja is really changing the game with these.

Pro tip: Ive been using non-Ninja pellets in this and my Woodfire grill with no issues. The off brand pellets really open up the flavor options and saves money too. Just buy quality ones designed for food, NOT FUEL! Bon appetit!",5,0,0.8948592485543377

I like the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as a premium smartphone. I also like the 5,000mAh battery, which does provide sufficient battery life , a full day for frequent use and 1.5 days for light use . Talking about the camera setup on the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. I didn't notice that much difference despite a quad-camera system featuring a 108-megapixel primary sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto lens, and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens. One thing I like the most of the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G is the S Pen support, which makes it one of the few smartphones that offer stylus compatibility. The S Pen can be used for taking notes, drawing, or navigating the phone. It made my life a lot easier with the quick notes taking feature. However there is one thing I didn't like about the new phone which is the removal of the audio port for microphone on the Samsung S22. I won't be able to use your existing headphones or external microphones that require a traditional 3.5mm audio jack without using an adapter. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G seems to be a nice device for users who want a premium smartphone with long battery life, and advanced features like 5G connectivity and S Pen support. However, it is also an expensive device. I will give it 4 out of 5 as my final verdict.",4,0,0.8735460543558407

2. If using separate the home button to go to the main menu Is very easily pressed if younger player is using the controller or someone with bigger hands? I could easily hold it differently but I also wear an xs women's glove.

I've only had MK8 since August and played maybe a dozen or so times and while I love MK8D for pure nostalgia and clean entertainment, just like I still play MK64, I wouldn't otherwise.

It is a sturdy unit that doesnt seem the least bit chintzy or cheap  this microwave was not made with the bottom dollar in mind. It has sensors to ensure proper cooking and cook times, a convenient timer, and a clock. I especially appreciate the express cook one-button time cook 1-6 for 1 to 6 minutes of cooking, and the button to add 30-seconds to the cook time is extremely handy, too. I use it frequently, more so than I ever wouldve expected to, and I really enjoy and appreciate the convenience it brings by its thoughtful design by people who are obviously forward-thinking and have the consumer in mind. I would recommend this microwave to anyone who thinks product longevity is more important than just getting the job done as cheaply as possible and prefers lasting products to those that are made to be thrown out and replaced when the cheap components quickly fail. The same folks who would rather pay a little more for good quality and utility of an appliance that will last nearly a lifetime, as opposed to the least expensive option that still looks modern and in-style, but the enamel chips after a month of use and causes arcing for most of its service life *cough*cough*Im looking at you, Emerson!

This S22 Ultra did not disappoint as it was in my opinion a much better version of the note series. Does everything the note 20 ultra did, with more style and a few extra features. The s pen doesn't get enough attention in my opinion but I use it for soooo many things. Simple screenshots and highlighting parts of screenshot before I send to a friend, or Simple note taking, or making lives and gif photos! Endless possibilities. Also, I tried the iPhone 13 pro max when it came out also, I could not believe how people could even put it on the same scale as samsung. Samsung allows you to do multiple things at the same time with such speed and so easy and user friendly. I can minimize any screen or app and put It in a small corner if I want, to watch news or something, while simultaneously online shopping and texting all from the same screen. Can't do that with apple. Just saying! Get the Samsung! Oh!!! And there literally is no better camera. Takes jpg and raw photos if you want to edit and be like a professional photographer with it lol. I am not but my stuff comes out great with the basic settings. I do like having the options to enhance photos though. Great phone. Will eventually upgrade to the s 23 ultra once the trade in value is a tad bit better for me.

I bought mine at the Big Box S club store (It was less and had the cover and pizza peel inc). Also note the price of these just dropped Everywhere (03-10-24)! Could there be a new model on the horizon?
This oven made fabulous pizza out of the Box (Heating it on Max for 30 min before starting Pizza setting). We got the take and bake pizza from California Pizza Kitchen for $8, Used the Neapolitan setting (with and without smoke depending on diners preference) and pulled it at 3 min or less getting a little edge char but the perfect crunchy base crust, melted but not burned cheese, and crispy edged pepperoni. We're not new to pizza ovens having had the Ooni gas oven for a few years but their volt(?) was more than I wanted to pay. This electric oven was as good as the gas version without the terror of an inferno that one has with early uses of the gas oven as well as no constant turning and babying the pizza. In fact you can't baby the pizza.. the door is closed and there's NO window!
We usually use our own dough and make our pizzas from scratch so we'll see how those are, but I'm expecting it will be great, and so much easier to do than before.

Weve been a fan of Ninja products for a while because of their build quality and durability. This outdoor oven is no exception. Its heavy and feels like a premium product. Unboxing is super simple. Just lift the top of the box off. There are a few foam pieces and then you get to the oven. Ours arrived with a small dent on the side which must have happened at the factory since the packaging was intact with no damage. At this price point Id normally dock a star for this but since it in no way affected the functionality Im leaving it as five stars.

The instruction manual is very straightforward and clearly shows how to use the oven. Got it fired up and made pizza last night. My advice is to start on a lower temperature to see how quickly it cooks. I used the recommended setting and time for a Neapolitan crust and it burned. Tried again at a lower temp and it cooked perfectly. Overall really impressed with how these turned out.

This new microwave oven is a replacement for GE Model JES1451DN1BB which quit on me a couple of days ago. The former oven was purchased as a floor model and didn't last as long as I had hoped - about 4-5 years. The first problem was that the turntable would continue to rotate when the oven door was open. This went on for about a year. While it worked, I was very happy with it. It was easy to use and heated food well; it also had sensor cooking. My new oven is very similar, but without sensor cooking. GE has many similar model numbers which, I guess, confused me. I assumed that the new model was simply an update of the old. This isn't too much of a problem as I didn't use the sensor feature often. What I really like is the high power express cook and the ""add 30 seconds"" functions. I'm hoping that they work as well in my new GE as they did in the old one. I think that anyone wanting a simple-to-use microwave that heats foods evenly and has the aforementioned features at a good price will not go wrong with Model JES1460DS3BB (I searched without the ""3"" in the model number).",4,0,0.8462015309418108

The sheer brightness of the Samsung logo upon powering on was new to me. This phone has triple the brightness of my previous phone, and let me tell you, it shows. I love being able to use this phone outside and not having to deal with sun glare on thr beach. Additionally, the Snapdragon Gen 1 chip in this phone is more than powerful enough for any task: gaming, mild video editing; this thing is a tank. It once got me out of a crunch at work where I had no access to a desktop to video edit. I was able to use Samsung's DEX to use my phone as a desktop on an external display. It was very user friendly and did not impact battery life. That brings me to my next point... the battery on this phone is amazing. Not only has it held consistent charges through different charging methods (ie. Wireless, Super-Fast Charging, Normal, etc.), but the reverse wireless charging that I can use with my Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and any other devices that need to be charged has helped me out tremendously. Finally, the camera is amazing. Truly, amazing. I have been asked countless times to share my photos with others, and using Samsung QuickShare, I can do that without compromising quality. I have used video and photos shot on the S22 Ultra for professional production, and taking 8k video makes video editing a breeze. Showing off this camera is my favorite thing to do, especially with S-Pen and Watch controls. Great job Samsung! S23 incoming!",5,0,0.8427044480817977

There is a very wide variety of tracks, being 48 in total (32 from the original game and 12 from the dlc). All the tracks are creative and have their perks, as with any Mario Kart game.

BATTLE MODE IS BACK! There was a battle mode on Mario Kart 8, but it was famous for being lazy (It used race tracks from the game and only had balloon battles). This is all fixed in Deluxe, with eight dedicated battle courses and five battle modes, all of which are amazing.

There are new/returning characters such as Bowser Jr., King Boo, and INKLINGS! Still no Birdo or Diddy Kong, though.

The graphics are updated to 1080p and 60fps docked, from 720p and an odd 59fps on the Wii U.

There are very few flaws, those being small things such as the coin item being too prominent or Pink Gold Peach being a character.

This is the highest reviewed Mario Kart game to date, with the highest first day attach rate. It broke the first day sales record of Mario Kart Wii. This game is AMAZING!

I didn't even mention double items! They are a game changer!

It is very accessible for new players with options such as smart steering and auto acceleration. The only problem is that they are very easy to toggle on, so be careful.

I would definitely recommend. 10/10!",5,0,0.8406554320561708

Fast forward to 8 on the switch and the tracks remind me of F-Zero, which i think is pretty cool. I like the driving dynamics and how you have to use your brakes on 200cc to avoid hitting the walls, however, the use of items by the cpu characters gets really annoying. The blue shells, lightning, and ink blots occur almost in every lap. This becomes a nuisance after a while as the game seems to rely heavily on the use of items.

The color variation, as shown on the attached photo, may indicate a manufacturing defect. The start-up screen is too cluttered for me, and the settings are not user-friendly or convenient as in other LG OLED TVs Ive used in the past. Moreover, unlike many other TVs from LG and different manufacturers, the Remote Control for this particular TV doesnt have a pause button, which is inconvenient. For all of these reasons, I think this product is OVERPRICED and may need to go back to the drawing board. The noted issues, however, should not be taken as reliable indicators of how the rest of these brand-new TVs perform; it all depends on the users standards, expectations, preferences, and whether a significant number of defective TVs (of this kind and model) have reached the marketplace.",3,0,0.8012966150294162

It took the younger one a few spills before getting the hang of it, but once he did he is riding it very well. I would suggest starting out on grass and practicing before hitting the sidewalks and road. They do run well on all surfaces. I would also suggest purchasing good kids helmets and gloves as the motorcycle can reach almost 15 miles per hour. So far the motorcycles seem to be constructed very well. We charged the batteries a full 24 hours before initial use and the charge has lasted extremely well. The other great plus is that they are battery powered not gas so they will be easy to transport and can be ridden in most residential areas where kids gas powered vehicles are restricted. The only downside I see so far is that the batteries are not easy to access therefore making it a bit difficult to buy backups and quick change and they only come in one color making it a bit difficult for the grandsons to tell which one is theirs.

I was a little intimidated and apprehensive to use the Ninja Woodfire Outdoor Grill when I first got it but, I am learning how to use all of it's functions and actually enjoying our new level of cooking.

You only need to change the cooking function, temperature, time and if you want the woodfire flavor smoke added to your cooking choice. The pizza setting has extra custom settings to use, which includes what type of pizza you are cooking (frozen, thin crust, etc.) and will preheat the pizza stone for you so the crust comes out perfect each time! I love how easy the instruction book is to read and follow. It includes basic recipes for beginners to help ease into the outdoor oven. The package also included a pack of woodfire pellets. The all-purpose blend flavor gave our roast a mild woodfire flavor and turned our mac n cheese flavor into the most flavorful mac n cheese we have ever had!

125,8920,bestbuy,Igloo - IMX 24 Quart Cooler - Gray,94.99,Almost perfect outdoor oven,Dylnel,"Upon receiving this oven, I was excited to make my first pizza. First thing I noticed was the size. It is not too big and not too small for my yard which is great. The build quality is excellent and everything feels solid. Front door needs a little muscle to open. It is pretty tight which I wasnt expecting. No issue with that though.

Once setup, I started the oven up to cook at 700 degrees. Took about 25 minutes to reach this temp which was perfect as it gave me time to prep my pizza. 
Right before I put the pizza in the oven, I added the included pellets which give off a nice smoke but at 700 degree it would be a quick cook so its really not enough time for the smoke to sink in.

I followed the directions for a Neapolitan which said 700 degrees for three minutes. Checked on it after 3 minutes and it was definitely cooked, maybe a little overcooked. What would be very helpful is putting glass on the door or somewhere to view the pizza as it cooks to avoid having to open and close the door as it cooks.  This is my only issue with this oven.

Dont get me wrong, I am sure with some practice I can figure out the right amount of time to cook the pizza at such a high heat. At the same time, I feel like no two pizzas are the same so it may not be that easy. Time will tell.

Overall, it is a great well made product but I have to take a star away due to the fact that there is no way to view what is being cooked.",4,0,0.7923264702849776

It was written after I had spent hours trying to fix my printer and was unable to reach anyone at HP. I was ready to throw printer into the garbage but decided to try the Geek Squad as a final attempt. They connected me to the remarkable team of Jennifer and James. Quess what? The printer was fine but my PC was infested with malware, corrupt drivers and mangled programs. They literaly worked for hours to put my computer, printer, and my wife's laptop into good order.  And installed virus and malware protection into our computers. It was expensive but worth it.
My experience made me read a lot of the one-star reviews and I am puzzled. I had no trouble setting up and the printing, scanning and copying went fine. Just that one day the printer stopped working.  A couple of things I learned: The black and color cartriges should be activated every one or two weeks, to prevent ink coagulation. If you won't use the printer for a few months read up on what you can do do to keep print head from dying.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hose for stretching the vacuum up the stairs does not come close to the full length advertised. At the full length stretched I cant get to the last 2-3 steps and at that point the vacuum falls over and starts getting pulled up the stairs. FYI I also find that the upholstery attachment gets the animal hair out of the stair runner rug and carpet better than the stair tool. By the way the upholstery tool is unbelievably amazing. It makes quick work out of getting cat hair off chairs and couches. Truly awesome! This vacuum is so amazing that the less than stellar stair hose does not keep me from loving it.

I dont have a shade in this line. I tried 405 and it was too light, then I tried 417 which was too dark. Since the coverage is somewhat light, I can still work with those shades by adding more concealer/bronzer. But not worth the hassle for me.",4,0,0.7846635586487498

Accessories that would be fine as friction fittings actually require alignment and mechanical fittings. They also require mechanical disconnection.
To use those accessories the body must be disassembled.
The extension hose to mount the accessories is much happier in its resting state and fights when extended. Not great for grooming.
For something sold as a pet groomer, it it wrongly engineered and inconvenient. I'll be keeping it because it still does well on rugs and floors. I can think of much better ways to groom pets.

Just for reference: the Yeti will hold ice for most of a work day, inside my truck, with ice turned to cool water by the end of day. The igloos will last 2 days (it will be ice and water). No cooler will hold ice for 5 days inside of a hot truck in central Texas.

Random non-Mario characters being in it, needing to collect coins, and gliding/underwater/zero gravity wall-driving all take away from the fun of racing. I personally also think that items are too big of a factor in winning (although it's not nearly as bad as the Wii Mario Kart was in this aspect).

229,9054,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,This is a Wii-U Port,Bryan,"This game, while an improvement, is quite literally a Wii-U port. Many will simply shove this off as Mario Kart itself is simply a continued resurrection of the same core gameplay. However, this game is notably a copy/paste of Mario Kart 8 on the Wii-U that they didn't even bother to change the name enough. They actually fixed the battle mode, fixed the item system during matches, and offered all DLC in lump-sum purchase. The game itself is a better rendition this time with HD quality within the game but a lot of things are still amiss. For example, the coin item is still in the game, item distribution by default in online is still wacky, kart mechanics are not traditional, etc. Overall, this game is what you'd expect from a true Mario Kart game but we shouldn't have had to buy a Switch just to get it, PERIOD.",4,0,0.7323497520371319

The only negative comments about this I could find was the somewhat difficulty level of pushing. In all honestly if you dont have some resistance when operating then its probably not cleaning like it should be. This vacuum is not too difficult to push or pull and if it is you might need to address some other issues other than your vacuum.

I can play more than one video at once, with audio playing for both at the same time. Screenshots are nice. Front and back cameras are clear and high quality.

However, doing intensive things like streaming HD videos on YouTube, which is what I primarily do, can drain the battery quicker than usual. High quality games look great and can drain the battery as well. If I'm not watching videos, gaming, or things like that, the battery can last over a day.

As a professional photographer the camera is the most important feature I look for in a phone. I upgraded from the S21 Ultra and noticed a significant improvement in the photo's I was getting. Being able to shoot and edit RAW output is definitely a big plus. I plan to upgrade to the Galaxy S23 Ultra mainly for the camera improvements.

I can edit many of the photographs I take with the phone and my other cameras right on my Samsung S22U easily, and be confident they'll come out great. I'm very happy with the results I'm getting. A couple small details I would like to see center around ergonomics. It would be easier to use the S-pen if the screen were flat.

What really sticks out is the camera and it's near limitless capability. Since the last upgrade that brought the pro level features into the native app, I've never been happier. The last thing I'll mention is the ability to seamlessly switch between my phone and my laptop. This makes working out of a suitcase so much easier!

In fact, this is the first phone that feels more like Note series. It's been a year since I own it and the phone is rock solid with amazing performance. These days people talk about Cameras when it comes to mobile phones. This phone has great cameras. Wherever I go, people want me to take their pictures using my S22 ultra.

The conversations you have with your Hogwarts mates are sweet, funny, even touching at times. Youll come to have your favorites among them.

The backgrounds are beautiful, the music is great, and the story certainly keeps you interested rather than begging for the skip button.

However, the game frequently glitches in graphics-intense scenes with significant stuttering visuals, phantom enemy attacks, and missed commands.  A good example is the legendary enemies Spawn of Oggdo and Rancor.  Often times you dodge an attack correctly, see that you're out of danger, only to have the enemy glitch-turn and have their fatal attack land despite you being out of the way or another enemy blocking their path. 
 There is a glitch in which you get stuck in the back of the Mantis and can only resolve this glitch by completely closing the program and powering off the PS5 then restarting.  Lastly, the difficulty is INSANE on some of the bosses/legendary enemies/force tears.  My first run-through was only on ""Master"" difficulty and it took dozens if not over 100 attempts each to defeat the Spawn of Oggdo, the Rancor, and the Double Rancor.",4,0,0.5630379938414172

I changed my diet, made sure to brush my teeth after coffee - nothing seemed to help - stains always started reappearing around 5 months from my last cleaning. Then I switched back to my favorite toothpaste - this one! I've only been using it about a month, but the stains have virtually disappeared without a professional cleaning.

For what I use my phone for (email, texts, internet, a few apps), not much has changed, but for me, that's a good thing. One difference I appreciate, though, is the much larger screen size. I'm not sure I will ever want to go back to a smaller screen.  The phone comes with a stylus, which I haven't had a use for in the 3 weeks since I bought it.  The camera is apparently a lot better than the S10 (with a 100x zoom), but I haven't played with it much. I have noticed that photos show greater detail in the texture of things with this camera.  The S22 Ultra has a variable refresh rate, which is designed to save on battery, but I haven't really noticed my battery lasing longer than usual. I can go the whole day without needing to charge it, but that's typical for a new phone, in my experience. Lastly, I love the burgandy color!
