I have a minor problem paying the $25 fee to file (It should be free) but charging $45 to take that fee from the federal refund is a travesty. That fee is not mentioned when the pay from Federal Tazx option is selected. I bet the person who came up with that idea received a big pay increase- it has to cost TurboTax near zero for that service- the ability to deposit a refund into 2 account is setup, so all they do is tell IRS to send $25 to a TTax account. I have no problem with TurboTaz making money as long as all costs are stated. There is no reason to charge for state filing since the state has to desire electric filing - it reduces their costs. So TurboTax makes the charge since it can. Tax prep software has become a commodity - a software company will someday offer free transmission of all returns and will do veryt well.",1,0,

When I login online, it brings you to a page to start doing your taxes online. I don't want to do it this way, I want to download and install and do taxes on my own computer. There were many stops and starts involved in finally finding the download page and then downloading and installing. And I ended up installing twice, after deleting the first install attempt, since the software seemed to be hanging. Also, when trying to start the software once finally installed, I'd get the bouncing icon (I'm on Mac) and it would never open. So then I would restart, and when restarting it said Turbotax is hanging and do i want to do a force close. I chose force close. After this I could open Turbotax by double clicking on the return file icon itself. Also, when i tried to install state using the Download State button in left pane, it would bring up a screen saying i need to login to intuit. When I chose the button to login using intuit acct, it would bring up a blank window with a frozen progress circle. And I couldn't get out of this dialog to login to intuit. So I did another restart, and had to choose force close again. When I went back in, I went to Top menu File>Sign In, and I WAS able to sign in that way. Then it DID let me download state and continue. Apart from all the above frustration, the software when working, did seem to walk me through everything well as I am used to, and the efiling went smoothly.

It also will not take a blank address as found in another import. I found that the detailed information on the 1099-div to be downloaded has country of ""Mycity United States"". I have tried to override in step by step and the field is not available to fix. I fixed it on the forms but cannot get past the review. Foreign country is blank but still pink with an error. How can I over ride the error. Answer: There is a work around that took Turbotax support over an hour to find. Put in the correct city, state and zip code. Fix the Foreign Country by first changing it to a wrong value like “other country” then changing it to “not applicable”. This changes Foreign Country to a true blank value. I found an error that may be the route cause of the problem. The 9 digit zip code on the package snail mailed to me is correct. The zip code on my 1099 in the package is wrong in the last 4 digits. The bad digits are from the old zip code before we moved in 2019. Maybe either ----- or Turbotax saw the bad zip code and declared it a foreign address. The Turbotax AI incorrectly told me to fix the address problem in the step by step area for the 1099-div but the address is not there to fix. The address error is only visable in the forms and review versions of the 1099-div. Also the zip code shown is only 5 digits.",4,0,

I was not informed when I installed TurboTax online that it should be used with Windows 11. I couldn't complete the process because it stalled when it came to paying the 20$ for filing state. After communicating with Intel I learned it didn't do well with Windows 10. They suggested the problem was with my computer. I ended up paying the 20$ only to find out I still could not complete the process. In a desperate attempt to file my taxes, I ended up taking my computer to have it serviced. They indicated I would have to buy a new laptop because mine was old enough it could not handle Windows 11, and They will not be supporting Windows 10 in the near future. I just received my computer (still using Windows 10) today (3-7-2024). When I went to finish submitting my return it did not accept the fact that I already paid 20$ in February. I was required to pay 25$ because it was now March. I assumed I would be given credit for the 20$ previously paid. Not so. I ended up paying another 25$ so it cost me 45$ to file electronically. As I ended the process, I could see why it didn't allow me to accomplish the payment the first time. The screen on my computer hid the continue button. I could not scroll down far enough to make it visible any more than a sliver of a blue line which was not noticeable the first time. I carefully put my cursor on the sliver of blue. It did continued the process. Had I been able to see it the first time, I could have finished the payment process without having to obtain any help.

https://www.target.com/p/turbotax-2023-deluxe-federal-and-state-tax-software/-/A-89741680,TuboTax Needs Improvements,bob markeloff,"I’ve found TurboTax for 2023 is “dumbed down” resulting it in being more awkward to use and at times annoying. (I’ve been using TurboTax for more than 20 years.) I do realize that you are trying to reduce input errors for beginners and for those not used to working on a computer. But at the same time you must not alienate everyone else. Here are my main complaints and suggestions for improvement, in order to priority (or should I say annoyance?), the first being the most cumbersome. 1. I like many others, do not enter all my tax information in a single marathon session. I enter it every few days as tax forms arrive in the mail. The constant asking if I wish to delete an item because I don’t yet know it (such as a 1099-INT, 1099-DIV or 1099-R) is very annoying to me. (Not to mention time consuming.) The way it was done previously was better. The program only asked once and not again. Bring that back. If concerned about not entering something (and needing a reminder), save the asking for the start error checking section. OR allow the user to check a box saying don’t ask me again. 2. When entering information for a 1099-B, the interface to enter that date acquired has become overly complex and at times confusing. Saying something other than a date is very confusing. This only increases the chance of making an error, in my opinion. You ought to allow for entering VARIOUS or VAR in that date box. But need to add a note there saying to use VAR if there are multiple dates. This closer to the previous interface, such as used last year. 3. When entering W-2 information, if no state or local tax information is entered, bringing back that input section to verify is overkill. First, the program hasn’t checked if the user is in a non- state income tax state and not likely to need to enter anything. While I realize it is probably a common error to not enter the information, ask the user to confirm no entry. The interface used when no qualified dividend information is entered is much more tactful and gets the job done. Use something similar to confirm the no input. Also add a check box saying don’t ask again about state & local taxes. 4. While foreign tax section (for credit) did get better a few years ago, there is till more you can do. Right now it may be the only section where the user has to do complex arithmetic - multiplication, probably using a calculator to enter the information into TurboTax. (You implicitly assume the user has a calculator handy or can easily find that function on their computer.) Your goal should be to just enter information and let the program do all the difficult calculating, same as the rest of TurboTax. Start by adding Box 8 to the input section for 1099-DIV’s. Then in the foreign tax section, if no country was entered, do ask if this is from a regulated investment company or RIC. Continue by asking about each entry that had a foreign tax. Ask if the income was all foreign or the percentage of Box 1a income that was foreign. Last, the program out to make a recommendation regarding a tax credit or deduction.",4,0,

I DO wish though, that you would make it so that one could simply hit a button or function key, to ""repeat"" the last entry. I have to type in many IRS W2Gs and it would be SO NICE to be able to not have to continually enter the same information as I complete many of these forms when I am entering then into TurboTax. Also, you seem to have eliiminated the ability to start up previous year's TurboTax while the current year is running. Example, every year, it asks me information from the previous years return. So I just minimize the current return, and then go out there and start up last years turbotax, to get the information. This year though, it would not let me do that, saying I had to switch user to open it. Well it would not let me do that either, so I had to save the current file, log off, log on again then start last years turbotax, get the information I needed, log out of that, then go back into the current years turbotax, and then I was able to enter the information it requested!

The autostart feature didn't work so I had to find the .exe file to launch. The install had an error so I had to uninstall and start over (day 1). The biggest problem was trying to activate it. Even though I bought the CD version, I had to have an Intuit account to activate. According to Intuit, I already had an account, but I did not know the password. I went round and round trying to change the password to no avail (day 2). I called tech support but the rep was unable to help me, but she introduced me to a new path that appeared to lead in the right direction, but I kept getting failures when I tried to upload photos of my driver's license (why is that even necessary?) After trying that route for a few hours, I called tech support again (day 3). It turned out that the algorithm for changing the password was confused because I filed multiple returns last year. The only thing I could was create a new email account, which in itself was a 2-hour process), then use the new email to create a new Intuit account. Intuit needs to remove the requirement for an Intuit account when using the CD version. They also need to change the algorithm for recognizing users who filed multiple returns.",3,0,

The intent is to e-file. I recommend looking at steps before entering anything, and pulling your paperwork together. For the last 5 years we've been in Arizona, and it also has an income tax. I don't know if it's Turbo Tax or the State of Arizona that makes this more difficult than it needs to be, especially if you're e-filing and have to pay. There are 7 choices as to the reason for the payment. I had not seen an actual AZ return up to that point, so I chose ""Liability"", because we owe that amount. Apparently, I should have chosen ""140V"" (which I did not know until I got to the end of this unholy process - see my last sentence in this review). Allegedly, only 3 browsers are reliable enough to make payment. So, I downloaded Mozilla Firefox (Edge is not one of them), went to the appropriate website and paid by credit card. Then went back to Turbo Tax and continued. At that point it wanted to know if I was paying by direct debit or check, or take it out of the federal refund, with ONLY a $40 processing fee. Hey, I just paid that by CC! So I chose CHECK, and continued on, where it said I had to print pages even though I e-filed. :( Turns out it's a page one would attach to a check. OK; and at the bottom it says if you want to pay by credit card, then don't print the page. Glad I'm done for another year.",4,0,

Furthermore, if you choose to have that state e-file cost deducted from your refunds, there is an up-charge to $40 (PLUS tax). In total, you spend the $40+ on the software and additional $25-$40 on the actual submission. It's bothersome that they market the Deluxe+State as including 1 State, when in fact you need to pay nearly double in some instances to complete the submission.

For some reason, when I opened up the program to continue my tax return, there were now TWO returns showing, both IDENTICALLY named. I had to carefully examine the contents of each to determine which one to delete (the illegitimate one). I had to delete the file through a windows interface, as I couldn't see any way to delete it using TT's menu. After doing this, THREE files showed up. I gave up on this. I never e-file my state return, as they charge for it, and I refuse to pay for something that makes their job easier. TurboTax never gave me the option to print out my state return with only the required forms; instead, I could only print out the return using the records printing interface. Because of this, I'm sure I'm including worksheet(s) that aren't required for the ""return only."" And then, the state return printed out had pages related to e-filing, as if I'd e-filed this return. The cost of a state module should include all of the state forms that may be required, not just a few of the major ones. To have to obtain a separate form for calculating energy saving improvements like solar in this day and age is ridiculous. TurboTax should have them already, not something I have to print out, fill out by hand, and attach to my return. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this, or the product just isn't becoming easier to use and more comprehensive as most products would strive to be. Overall, a very disappointing experience this year.",3,0,

Both federal and state are pushing for this. Being retired, our income is all from investments. I would like a tool that I could input data from the monthly reports so that I could adjust the quarterly payments to avoid a penalty or overpayment at the end of the year.",4,0,

The most frustrating glitch was that the program kept stating that my routing number had too many digits but it was the correct routing number and the same one that I had used the previous year. I searched the internet for a solution and tried several but to no avail. I finally decided to try to direct deposit in to a different account and that worked however I did not want the deposit to go in to that account so I hit the back button and re-entered the account in question and it accepted it and I was able to deposit and complete my taxes. It ended up taking 4.5 hours instead of 2-3 hours. Very frustrating indeed!,4,0,

I now understand how the QCD function can be used to help in correct calculations for returns from IRAs. I do like having tools to compare my returns from year to year.

I'm guessing this is for security reasons. If I were doing my return on a public machine, or a less secure home machine, this makes sense. Some of us, however, do financial work on a dedicated pc that is turned off unless we are actively doing our finances. We only access secure financial sites and DON'T do email on this machine. Anyone who can access our copy field cache would be much better served with just copying our Turbo Tax return! Disabling fields forces us to hand type long mixed alpha-numeric fields. Gee... What could possibly go wrong? At least let us have a secure machine option that enables such input. In other words, we take the risk that some nefarious hacker will steal random entries from the copy field cache and use it to steal all our riches. Well, like I said earlier, unless they decide to do it the hard way and just copy our tax return.",3,0,

This was a 2022 amended return. The reason that I had to file an amended return was because I had manually entered a 1099-R and then decided to have the application automatically enter the values which worked very well. The only problem was that I did not notice that the original manual entry was still in the system so had a double entry in my return for this 1099-R. I didn't notice it until I entered this year's taxes and looked at the comparison from the previous year and saw the large difference.

However, I've been using TurboTax for several years and I find the software to be thorough, relatively easy to use, and I never had a problem with TurboTax or with any of my tax filings. Having said that, my taxes are pretty simple and straight-forward. Those whose qualifications are similar to mine but have a more complex tax situation including multiple income sources, multiple personal and business investments, properties, foreign investments, etc., will also benefit from TurboTax but I would have a second qualified source review the final results after my first experience with TurboTax and before submitting them to the IRS.",4,0,

Then, regardless of how much you paid, if you want to e-file state, that's not included and you will be charged an additional 20 bucks. Three seperate payments totaling over 100 dollars.

I've run into an issue with your system however - I work as a civilian employee of the Air Force and as such the Defense Finance and Account System (DFAS) is the people/systems that pay DoD hundreds of thousands of employees. My issue is because DFAS does not use School District Numbers in their W-2 with-holding boxes (Box 20) for school districts that with hold taxes. If I enter exactly what is on the W-2, your system does not recognize my school district tax being with held. My only method is to enter the SD number into box 20 ahead of the letters that DFAS uses for the school district - this is an issue that needs to be resolved. DFAS isn't going to change their systems as I ran into in issue with the wrong district being withheld - I was able to get that fixed - however DFAS just chose different letters instead of the SD numbers.

I also have to hold my breath at the end when it determines if there are any errors to fix.

The only complaint I have is why does it cost so much to file a state return that needs to change. I will never pay that price to file a return. Michigan should not be charging us to file a return. We are helping them with less paperwork and we have to pay. Ridiculous Thanks for continuing to produce a great product.,5,0,

Instead of taking me straight to the TT home screen to retrieve my return I had to click on a pop up window which led me to my TT account which I then had to login to and then enter my software key code before I could get to that home screen. Did that probably three times. The second glitch happened during e-filing, specifically, at the billing information screen to confirm in order to pay the $20 fee to file the state return. The ""Continue"" button on the screen to confirm the billing information was below my laptop screen. I had to click and hold the window and move it to as far to the top of my screen as possible to just catch enough of that continue button in the lower right corner and then click on it with my other hand while still holding that window all the way to the top so I could pay the fee and continue with e-filing.

I lift the back tire and turn throttle, motor wines and nothing happens. if lucky, the wheel may turn 1/4 revolution after 30 seconds of holding the throttle with no weight. Do not buy this thing.

My kids are extremely hard on toys and these little babies have held up great! We originally bought one for our 4 year olds birthday and it was such a favorite that we ended up buying 2 more so that all of our kids could ride together. It’s great fun, therapeutic, and bonding time for them. We added aftermarket clip on led headlights and taillights for them so that they can night ride when the sun sets earlier. Every child that rides it falls in love. We have recommended them to family, friends, and neighbors and can’t say enough good things. These babies definitely will get your kids feeling like the coolest kids in town. Lots of stares of admiration from passerby’s and neighbors. We enjoy watching our kids smiles and laughter while they ride these. We are an adrenaline junky family and own several adult and youth machines and for the kids these are hands down the most durable and zero maintenance (if you know you know). Eventually brakes would have to be changed out but that’s nothing that will need to be done for a few years and is an easy change. Out of box set up is minimal and simple. If you’re sick of rebuilding cheap and expensive plastic powerwheels, these dirt bikes are your answer! Pull the trigger and go for it. Affordable, durable, and an absolute blast for all who ride them. Battery life on a full charge is probably about 30 minutes of continuous riding up and down hills. Do not let the suggested age fool you (liability purposes, youth machines always overstate the age limit) If your child can ride a bike well at 3 or 4 they can handle it just make sure you are along side them to train them to use the hand brakes and not whiskey throttle. I would say age range is more fit for ages 4-9 at best.",5,11,Verified purchaser

We got the idea from some neighbors who had some older brothers and they kept getting handed down to the younger siblings. Now, we have a younger motorcycle club that rides around the neighborhood nonstop. The battery lasts what seems to be all day with them riding it on and off, so we have no complaints on lengthy charge times or short ride times. They never complain they are dead. In fact, it may have been completely drained 1 time and she was worn out from riding it all day anyway. Also, my 12yr old daughter also likes to ride this bike but she looks funny because it is almost too small for her, so I agree with the other reviews that you want to buy a bigger bike for a 13+ year old. l..

So I plugged it in and the next day it went it's top speed of 14 mph and the only problem was that the battery did not last anything close to 30 minutes and it was fully charged so I though the battery probably got damaged.

On Christmas morning, her Mother rode it into the living room, and my GrandDaughter lost her mind! She immediately took it to the backyard and rode it for what seemed like hours. Even though she's small for her age, this bike is the perfect size for her. 14 mph doesn't seem like a lot, but this thing is FAST! My GrandDaughter loves her new Razor Dirt Bike, she and her mother took turns riding it. I think my Daughter enjoyed it more than my GrandDaughter, LOL!

I purchased a brand new factory sealed unit from a not so local retailer just before the Super Bowl. I drove 150 miles round-trip to pick up this unit. Imagine my disappointment when I opened the sealed box to discover there was no remote, there was also no stand, and there was no protective film on the TV screen. Without a stand, I was unable to watch the Super Bowl on my brand new TV. The local retailer offered to deliver a new unit, but only after the Super Bowl. I think the actual TV Picture and its ease of use is a pretty solid four star. I had no trouble hooking it up to my DSL based Internet and getting it set up.

OLED TVs May Be Addictive,OLED Fan42,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Our family has enjoyed LG's OLED TV platform in our home theater for the last few years. OLED offers amazing picture quality, and the whole family appreciates the breathtaking images. An OLED TV in a dark viewing room is breathtaking-- the inky blacks do not disappoint. We decided to replace the TV in our great room, and after a lot of checking, it became evident that there are not a lot of options for high-quality small TVs that include features like Dolby Digital. And, while I started looking at other platforms to ""expand our horizons,"" we landed squarely back in the OLED camp. I appreciate that LG has made this unit with some thickness to it. Our other OLED TV is so thin as to be almost impossible to handle. The stand is well designed, and the cable management is a nice touch since this particular unit is not wall mounted. Because of the efficient stand and bezel design, we were able to gain significant screen area compared to the older LCD TV that it replaced. My only complaint with the LG is the welcome screen icons/apps are a bit much-- a clean design would be a much-welcomed upgrade. (Same with our previous OLED unit from LG.) I didn't realize just how clunky the interface is since our previous unit is connected to an AV processor that handles most of the system control. This unit is a freestanding unit with a couple of connected components. The unit's software works well and provides control of all the connected components fluidly. Also, the cable cover on the rear of the TV doesn't handle multiple HDMI cables very well. That's a minor issue. Again, our only complaint is we wish LG would create a cleaner user interface... but I bought it for an amazing picture. The interface is just an annoyance.",5,0,

When I was looking for new and bigger TV, I saw that the LG C3 was one of the highest-rated OLED TVs on the market. So, I decided to purchase it. The setup was a little complicated, especially turning off the annoying Voice-Assistant that doesn't shut up (hard to find the setting to turn it off). I initially used the Picture Wizard to customize the picture. However, it seems as though my choices resulted in faces being too orange. So, I had to do it a 2nd time to tame it down a bit. I prefer a very ""warm"", vibrant picture, that really captures the colors of the images shown. I also had issues with some TV shows that are older in nature (non-HD), with resolution. I had to mess with settings in order to correct it, but it is still not great for these older shows. As far as modern shows go, having gone from regular HD to OLED 4K, I expected to have my socks blown off by the picture, but I did not. The picture is decent, but doesn't excite me for a TV that is rated so highly. I had originally wanted to purchase a different brand that is known for its highly-touted picture quality, and perhaps that is what I should have stuck with. The LG C3 does get the job done, but it isn't impressive in my opinion.",3,0,

The different picture modes are great and I love that gaming mode automatically activates when the gaming system is turned on. The picture itself is absolutely top notch. My complaints are relatively minor critiques. I do not find the screen saver feature very useful. It allows you to display artwork or a clock etc, but I would prefer my TV to just be off when I turn it off. This means you have to hit the power button twice to actually power off the TV. The remote is a bit cluttered and could be a bit more minimalist in my opinion. Dedicated buttons for streaming services seem ambitious given how much change we are seeing with those, and a full numeric keypad is a bit archaic. While the TV supposedly is compatible with Google Assistant, the assistant is not built in and even after linking my LG account to my Google home, I have yet to be able to get Google Assistant to control the TV in any useful way. Again, I am overall very satisfied with the product, these are just a few small things that keep it from being truly five stars.",4,0,

We loved the picture, the sound, the quality in general. But it took two months and four visits from The Geek Squad to make it work right. The TV kept turning itself on spontaneously, sometimes in the middle of the night. After trying very hard to figure out the issue (including changing out the entire main board), the Geek Squad concluded the problem may have been the ""magic remote."" It is complicated to use (who makes a remote without a pause button that is easily accessible???) and not intuitive. If this could be made more user friendly, it would enhance the TV. Note: We did have another remote (cable), a sound bar and headphones also plugged in, so some of these devices may have complicated the electronic set-up. Still, we've never had such difficulty with a TV set up before.",4,0,

I’m happy with the set’s performance, but there is no manual included, just a very brief overview of the setup.

For example I have no clear idea if I need the included IR Blaster accessory or how it works. What users need is a full-size comprehensive manual with pictures explaining every control and feature and how to use them. A pictorial menu tree would be helpful as well.

In this particular area I take great interest, because right now, in my professional opinion, YouTube dominates this space, but then you get bombarded with ads in between long form content meant to be just playing quietly in the background. Artists! Listen up and take advantage of the space these televisions provide to showcase your work! Handles all incoming visuals and sound from my console flawlessly. I have yet to use my soundbar surround bluetooth without turning on the television, but don't expect at this level, for the television to get confused thereafter, like lower priced products. The television, in other words, handles all ""technological handshakes"" like a pro! Plenty of HDMI 2.1 connections as well! Very thin, sleek and sharp design! Light! I had to toss the box because it wouldn't fit in storage, but will worry about transporting the item safely when we cross that bridge. Overall, and again, nothing but great things to say!",5,0,

Wonderful images, a big step up from 40” LCD without 4K. Magic Remote is good, but could really use a backlight option to avoid misclicks in the dark. The mouse-cursor feature is very handy but is a bit squishy. Would be nice not to be constantly reaiming it. The big downside is HDMI eArc to the LG65Q soundbar. It’s great when connected but it has a tendency to get confused and look for an optical connection. There isn’t one so the sound is mute. Seems to have something to do with a power down sequence. It will be fine all day but after being idle all night it will revert to optical. It’s frustrating getting it to recognize HDMI again. Unplug both devices and restart seems to resolve it fairly reliably but that’s a pain. It’s easy enough to find reports of the same issue from others online, so it’s really disappointing that LG hasn’t addressed it.",4,0,

(Especially with the good deals going on around the holiday season) It has great brightness, amazing color and of course the True Black levels are perfect. It’s got 4 HMDI 2.1 ports which is great so if you game on a next gen console you won’t be disappointed. So far I’ve had zero issues and the tv has been perfect. I know a lot of people say OLED tvs aren’t good in bright rooms that get a lot of sunlight but my living room is pretty bright and gets a good amount of sun and even when the sun is shining through the room the TV is still completely fine to watch things on. Of course if you want to enhance the experience I suggest just closing some curtains to the point where there’s no direct sunlight on the TV. It is definitely not as bright in the sun as it is at night but regardless don’t let it steer you away if you have a bright room and still want the experience of an OLED. OLED is an experience unlike any other type of tv that is out right now and it is 100% worth the money especially if you watch a lot of movies. That said, I’d highly recommend going with LG for the best bang for buck OLEDs. If you don’t wanna completely break the bank but still want a high end OLED then LG is the way to go. Especially the C3 Cheers",5,0,

And, we have yet to figure out how to get the free three month trial of Apple TV+. (I was able to link to the one week trial, but will need to call LG promotions office later today. The only downside of new TV is that my wife hates having to deal with four remotes (one for Directv box, one for external sound, one for Roku, and one for LG TV).

Very realistic rendition of all video and sports look the best! You cannot compare the true black and vivid contract that you get by having no back light like other panel displays. The features are easy to use and remote can be used a s a mouse by simply pointing in different directions on the screen. Great for navigating the built in web browser, and remote control microphone also does speech to text so you don't have to type in web searches. You can also link the TV to other devices like Alexa and I have it set up to show family pictures as a sreen saver. The built in free LG TV channels provide additional content and I also use an over the air antenna with it to over 30 free local HD channels. The HDMI 2.1 eARC is the latest interface and works flawlessly with Denon Sound Bar and SubWoofer. The TV even listens to you room when you set it up to optimize the sound. Consider the LG Sound Bar if you are buying both at the same time. The LG Sound bar and TV have additional interface features including music streaming that are better than my Dennon. I bought a smaller one for the bedroom because the backlight on our previous TV made the room to bright. i do wish that remote had backlight for that room. but that is solved by using the microphone button to switch channels and even set the sleep timer.

The picture is brighter and has true colors. I'm not sure how a picture could be better. Especially when the source is 4K Dolby Vision with Atmos.

As a self-proclaimed TV aficionado and an unapologetic snob, I've traversed the landscape of Sony and Samsung, only to find my true allegiance lies with LG's OLED marvel. In a tale of technological evolution, OLED emerged as the beacon of brilliance, leaving other manufacturers in the dust. Sony and Samsung, once pioneers, found themselves trailing in the wake of LG's supremacy. Having embraced OLED with unwavering confidence, LG emerged not just as a participant but as the clear victor in the grand theater of visual delight. My journey with LG's OLED TVs has been nothing short of a love affair, and this marks my third dalliance in a mere two years. Slowly but surely, I am ushering these wonders into every nook of my abode, transforming mundane spaces into captivating realms of cinematic splendor. Brace yourself, for disappointment has no place in the presence of an LG OLED. Yet, let's address the nuances. This TV is a virtuoso tailored for the realms of streaming 4K content and gaming ecstasy. It dances with pixels and breathes life into digital landscapes, inviting you to immerse yourself in a visual symphony. However, it might not be the ideal companion for cable aficionados.

It's thin and sleek, and fit our Man-Cave perfectly. The biggest thing for me was finding something that could fit both my need for gaming and sports. Being able to switch between Rocket League and NHL games, or go from the NBA to Call of Duty has been beyond ideal. Another feature that's been huge is the cast to TV. The LG app works really really well with the TV, especially in casting my video work up on the big screen. While the audio does have same connectivity issues from time to time, the pros far outweigh the cons.",5,0,

The crisp, bright picture is remarkable and it’s bright regardless of room atmospherics - literally I don’t think any other brands have something comparable to this screen technology. The viewing angle does not make a difference in picture clarity. The sound from the internal speakers is surprisingly good, voices are clear and has a good amount of base- probably the best internal tv sound I’ve ever heard. The only thing that made me rate it four rather than five stars is I’ve not been able to stream picture and sound via the HDMI connection as I could on my previous (2018) LG tv. It doesn’t matter what type of cable or HDMI connection cable I use, it just doesn’t work. A big disappointment considering I like to stream hockey matches through my laptop and I can only use my laptop speakers for playback. The tv recognizes the computer connection, but no settings or adjustments to any settings resolve the lack of sound. It’s surprising considering I did this successfully on an earlier non OLED LG television. Otherwise outstanding performance, easy to connect a cable box, a blue ray player and to connect a soundbar via the digital optical cable. I recommend this television and will strongly consider purchasing an LG television again.",4,0,

This TV makes any content I consume look absolutely sublime. From video games to streaming, even SDR content looks and feels like HDR. I always recommend LG OLED TVs because they are simple to use and feature-rich. Airplay is seamless for streaming. The apps launch quickly compared to other smart TVs' interfaces. I love the features they added to the 2023 models. Picture by Picture finally works with physical HDMI inputs, which is great for PCs and gaming consoles. The new audio, live paintings, and minimalist clock are beautiful. It truly turns this device from a TV into an ambiance piece. The design is absolutely elegant. The thin bezels with glass really add to that allure and aesthetic. Surprisingly, the built-in TV speakers are quite good. But the eARC connection is even better. I did not have any issues with the TV remote controlling audio on my soundbar from the LG OLED remote. The smartphone app is quite convenient because it allows you to control the TV without relying on where you placed the physical remote. One of the best features of the TV is that it supports Dolby Vision along with G-Sync. Gaming on the console and PC is a blast. The blooming always bothered me on mini LED televisions. Since this is an OLED, the response time is <1 ms. It is amazing. Motion clarity is fantastic. I earnestly look forward to LG OLED TV's yearly release because I love seeing the technological advancements. It's still going to be a while before this quality becomes the norm. But I'm grateful OLED technology has finally become affordable. In real life, once it's set up in your home theater, there is no comparison to IPS or VA panels. The clarity, response times, and vibrancy of the images are remarkable. If you are unsure, 100% go see one in person. It's a little tricky to tell in showrooms with bright lights beaming on them. But if you can go to the home theater sections or see the TV in the dark, that's where OLED truly shines, and the difference becomes extremely obvious. The depth in the image is not replicable with Mini LED due to the lack of dimming zones. These 4K OLED televisions have 8.3 million pixels, and on OLED, those are all individually controlled dimming zones. Everything on this TV looks great. For me, I go out of my way to only consume content on my LG OLED TV. It's genuinely that good!",5,0,

It has a nearly-instantaneous response time and incredibly low input lag, so games, or your mouse cursor, are fluid and responsive, with almost no distracting motion blur behind fast-moving objects. Its viewing angle is amazing, so even if you sit in front of the TV, you won't notice any discoloration or dimming at the edges. It gets bright in SDR and has amazing reflection handling, so it'll look great even if your office setup is in a bright room or in front of some windows. Unfortunately, like many TVs, the C3 doesn't use a standard RGB subpixel layout, so text isn't very clear when used as a monitor, and its brightness in SDR is significantly reduced when the TV is set to PC mode, or with the 4:4:4 Passthrough option set to on. Finally, as with all OLEDs, there's a risk of permanent burn-in when exposed to static elements, like the UI elements of a computer desktop.",5,0,

I was satisfied with the current TV but couldn’t be happier with the upgrade - this television in an improvement in every measurable category. The colors are incredibly vibrant and detailed. The OLED panel displays contrast to an extreme degree. The darks are pitch black and the colors pop off of the screen. The television works best in a dark environment but the brightness of the C3 makes it effective for my viewing in all light environments. I use an audio receiver and the ARC output of the HDMI works well with zero lag. The UI is intuitive and the applications run quickly and without delay. The remote is impressive and controls every media device in my cabinet (allowing me to declutter my living room). The system can also be set up to control the volume of the audio receiver - again eliminating clutter. The device will turn on the receiver automatically when the TV turns on. The television is very thin and when mounted with a pan and tilt mount, it has improved travel compared to the TV it replaced. While it is thin, it doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. The material is durable and feels solid. I selected this TV after reading numerous reviews stating it the was the best in its category. I am happy to report that it has exceeded my expectations. Streaming, physical media, and gaming all seem upscaled and improved to how they were on an alternative device. I game with a Super Nintendo (both classic and original release are hooked up to the LG C3) and both operate perfectly with no lag. I use over the air broadcast and I have also found this to be stronger on this TV compared to its predecessor. The built in tuner has the ability to create a “guide” experience and show me what is on each channel prior to selecting the content. It also can receive internet TV through alternative providers and this offers me content that I was previously unable to enjoy. I have also tested the television with older physical media and find that it presents an improved picture. In conclusion; if you are looking for a modern TV that delivers the best experience for audio, video, and ease of operation, I would highly recommend the LG C3. My family has been blown away by the improvement from another 4K option and feel like now was the right time to upgrade. This TV also delivers incredible value - compared to offerings from competition, you will get a superior device and pay less. Getting the latest from a company that is pioneering display technology; you would make the right choice if you select the LG C3",5,2,

Coming from another brand, the menus were intuitive enough to navigate to calibrate to our room conditions and viewing preferences, and what a joy it is to have perfectly inky blacks, and a truly responsive implementation of the HDMI specification granting nearly seamless transitions from standard 4K to Dolby Vision HDR content. The 120Hz refresh rate with our Xbox Series console is a fantastic upgrade, and the gaming-specific features are also easy to navigate and toggle as necessary. The only downsides to this display I have noticed so far is the lack of embedded Google Chromecast or a means to play from our Google Movies & TV library outside of the YouTube app (which often only serves 1080p variants of this content), and that the ""mouse cursor"" feature of the remote being a bit annoying of an adjustment to familiarize with -- it feels like a fun gimmick to some, but I wish I could disable it and just use the arrow buttons to navigate. Overall, this is one of, if not the best purchases one can make to upgrade technology in their household, and I have no regrets in finally adopting the best of OLED with LG.",5,0,

I bought the TV through Costco and was able to reach tech support at Costco as well as LG very easily. LG has a chat function for Tech support which worked well and I was also able to speak by phone to a support agent. However, there are 3 major technical issues which is making me regret my purchase. First, there is no audio out jack on the TV. There is only Bluetooth and an optical connection. I wanted to use headphones, but you cannot use Bluetooth and the optical out at the same time. The optical out is connected to a sound bar. I ended up getting an optical splitter and then a optical to audio device so I could use non-Bluetooth head phones and the sound bar at the same time. The second problem is that I cannot use the ThinkQ application -- I called tech support and they said that the tablet/phone which has ThinkQ installed has to be on the same network. I tried mutiple times and it worked once from my tablet and I really liked the application, however, it no longer works -- it cannot find the TV. The tech support person said that if I am using ethernet for the TV, then I cannot use a tablet -- even though both are on the same router. The biggest problem is that I cannot use universal remote control that I alread own (it is a MX-500 from a company called Universal Remote Control which is no longer in business). This remote is programmed for a TIVO box (connected to HDMI 1, a BluRay player, a Roku and the Sony soundbar. I tried to learn the buttons on the Magic remote which came from LG, but it will not learn the buttons. I understand that the MX-500 can only be programmed from IR devices, but I don't know how to put the Magic remote into IR mode. I keep trying different solutions but have not fixed this problem -- very frustrating.",4,0,

I've been shopping/researching for a TV for quite some time as my previous ULED was having issues. I had seen many OLED TVs from different department stores and they immediately always caught my eye. So I was beyond thrilled at my opportunity to purchase my very own LG OLED. The box the TV comes in makes it easy for almost anyone to unbox this TV. I've seen how thin this TV in person was so I was a little nervous about how it would fare in transit. However, after receiving the TV and unboxing it I noticed plenty of padding to keep the TV safe and sturdy. The setup for this tv was very quick and easy and the tv is very light compared to others. Once the TV was plugged in, the setup process was very fast and I was watching this TV in no time. This TV will take your breath away as soon as the picture turns on. You will be met with tremendous colors and deep blacks that provide for an almost 3D-like appearance. This TV even makes standard-definition programs look substantially better. I've enjoyed trying out many different types of media such as PS5, 4k streaming and 4k Blu-ray discs. All of which have blown me away! This TV is an experience that must be tried and you will not be disappointed! This TV is also accompanied by Magic Remote. I was somewhat familiar with this remote as I had one with an older LG LED TV and the new one was leaps and bounds better than what I remember. I really can't say enough about this TV and there is no looking back from here on out, it's LG OLED or bust for me!",5,0,

Everything is all controlled through the large, full-featured Firestick remote. The picture is FABULOUS! The detail and color are amazing. The streaming works very well. It just takes the internet a little time to load an app. Overall, I am now praying to the TV gods to kill my ancient Sharp Aquos TV upstairs so I can get a 65"" LG OLED TV.

LG is the leader when it comes to OLED TV tech and this TV is a winner. It has all the bells and whistles anyone could want in a TV including Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 120hz motion for smooth console gameplay, and way more features than I can list here. Upon receiving the TV, unpacking it and setting it up was very straightforward but did require a second person to help me handle it because the TV is so amazingly thing. I decided to mount the TV, even though it comes with a nice stand. The quality of this OLED TV needs to be experienced in person to be truly blown away. The colors on this TV truly pop in such a way that it looks better than reality, and the blacks are truly black since each individual pixel can be turned off to show blacks. Our kids always love to play their games on it and I enjoy my movies especially with Dolby Vision for the best HDR quality that cant be matched. The magic remote that comes with the TV is also neat since it a curse that can be controlled just like a mouse which makes navigation and typing a breeze. The smart hub on the TV also allows you to download many apps including all the streaming apps one could want.

This LG C3 TV is noticeably brighter and better at handling reflections than the C2. I used this TV in a bright room in the daytime with a lot of natural light and never struggled to see any content on this TV. My first huge pluses for this TV is how well it has integrated with my PC as well as my other devices (streaming boxes, gaming consoles, and non-LG soundbar). Unlike other TVs I have used, I have had no issues with soundbar disconnects. On the PC side, this TV handled 120hz HDR adaptive refresh rate input with 7.1 surround sound over HDMI 2.1 with zero issue consistently. My second huge plus is the OLED technology itself. I am someone who always has captions on. If you have ever used a MINI LED TV or any other tv with a smaller number of local dimming zones, you will know how distracting the backlighting can be around captions. This LG OLED TV has none of those issues. I am not a massive fan of the built-in app store. I have found that other built-in app stores are slightly more comprehensive but either way, you are best off pairing this TV with a high-performance streaming box for best picture quality and features with your streaming/music services. I am also not someone who uses the magic remote pointer feature often, but it isn't something that gets in the way. That being said, the CEC connection is another seamless feature of this TV in comparison to others I have tried and the buttons on the remote itself are pleasant enough that i don't find myself switching to my streaming devices' native remotes very often. Overall, this is the best TV I have used in a long time and a major step up from other technologies. The OLED self care features are unobtrusive and helpful. My TV arrived with a stuck pixel, but one cycle of the screen care took care of this issue right away. Strongly recommend.",5,0,
https://www.target.com/p/lg-65-34-class-4k-uhd-2160p-smart-oled-tv-oled65c3/-/A-88196023,Beautiful Sound and Color,Mrisacher,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had my TV since 2016, so when it came time to update my TV naturally I looked to one of the best brands in electronics: LG. The LG OLED Evo 65-inch model has surpassed all my expectations. It was very easy to unwrap and set up. The first thing I noticed was how slim the TV was - a noticeable difference from the TVs of 2016. While flipping through apps, I was amazed how quick the operating system was - there was virtually no lag. However, the remote control is very bulky with lots of buttons. I personally prefer a smaller remote with fewer buttons. Given how slim the TV is, I was surprised to see that the remote didn’t match it. But, this is a small issue. What really shines is the picture and sound quality. The bright colors are vivid, but, more importantly, the dark colors don’t bleed into each other. Instead, I can distinguish the finer details in darker images. In terms of sound, I was really surprised how good the quality was without my sound bar. Naturally, everything sounds better with a sound bar, but honestly if you don’t care much about sound, you don’t need one. Ultimately, this television is a testament to how far LG has come in terms of speed, audio, and color. If you’re looking for an upgrade, give the LG OLED EVO C3 series a chance!",5,0,

I've been shopping/researching for a TV for quite some time as my previous ULED was having issues. I had seen many OLED TVs from different department stores and they immediately always caught my eye. So I was beyond thrilled at my opportunity to purchase my very own LG OLED. The box the TV comes in makes it easy for almost anyone to unbox this TV. I've seen how thin this TV in person was so I was a little nervous about how it would fare in transit. However, after receiving the TV and unboxing it I noticed plenty of padding to keep the TV safe and sturdy. The setup for this tv was very quick and easy and the tv is very light compared to others. Once the TV was plugged in, the setup process was very fast and I was watching this TV in no time. This TV will take your breath away as soon as the picture turns on. You will be met with tremendous colors and deep blacks that provide for an almost 3D-like appearance. This TV even makes standard-definition programs look substantially better. I've enjoyed trying out many different types of media such as PS5, 4k streaming and 4k Blu-ray discs. All of which have blown me away! This TV is an experience that must be tried and you will not be disappointed! This TV is also accompanied by Magic Remote. I was somewhat familiar with this remote as I had one with an older LG LED TV and the new one was leaps and bounds better than what I remember. I really can't say enough about this TV and there is no looking back from here on out, it's LG OLED or bust for me!",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/lg-65-34-class-4k-uhd-2160p-smart-oled-tv-oled65c3/-/A-88196023,"beautiful picture quality, great sound",tnye,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the LG C3 TV to replace an old projection TV. Needless to say, the display quality is leagues better. But the C3 OLED display is really much better than many other TVs on the market. The picture quality is really stunning. Installation of the TV is pretty straightforward. The stand is remarkably steady despite its small footprint. Having the cable connections on the left side of the back of the TV makes connecting cables very easy. The sound quality of the TV's built-in speakers is surprisingly good. I expected really tinny sound from such a thin TV, but at higher volume you can actually get some pretty rich sound. You can get even better sound from the LG SC9 soundbar designed for this TV, which I did purchase, but that's for a different review. One of the things I like is you can organize apps at the bottom of the home screen, putting favorites in a preferred order. Adding apps is very easy. The web OS is pretty clunky. It's nowhere near as simple to use for internet surfing as a computer, but you can access the internet with it and bookmark favorites. I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the Magic Remote. It can be very annoying when you do not want to use it, and yet it does make it a lot faster to do some things such as accessing sections of the quick menu, entering passwords, URLs, etc. Also, while it's possible to buy an extra Magic Remote (which I did do - they're not very expensive), only one will be able to use the magic pointer (you can still navigate using the wheel with a second remote). One of my biggest concerns about buying an OLED TV was possible burn-in. LG put some great safeguards in place with this TV to help prevent it. One feature I use very frequently to prevent burn-in is the pixel cleaning feature. The only negative is it takes several clicks with the remote to get to it. A feature this useful should be just one click away on the quick menu. One major annoyance with this TV is it will not remember what you were watching when you turn the TV off. It always defaults to the home screen every time you turn it on, so if you have a favorite TV channel you like to watch, you have to reselect it every time you turn on the TV. Overall, my wife and I are extremely happy with this TV. The picture quality is magnificent, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. We bought ours on sale, and at that price point it was very competitive.",5,0,

Coming from a high end QLED TV, I didn't think it could get much better but oh was I wrong. The contrast ratio is so large that everything just pops. The blacks are true blacks, and the color accuracy is amazing. The AI functionality also brings the TV to the next level especially for the audio. There was a dramatic difference in sound quality after turning on the AI sound profile. If you have a compatible sound bar, the TV can sync to it and you can control both from the same remote which is very convenient. The app center is easy to use and all the apps that you would expect are available. Response time on the menus and apps is also excellent. I was also pleasantly surprised to find out the remote has a point and click feature which essentially makes it a mouse. Now for the reason I got this TV. Gaming! The largest selling point for me was HDMI 2.1 on all HDMI ports which allows 120hz refresh rate at 4K. The TV also has VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) and a dedicated game mode with both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-SYNC compatibility. I have both a latest gen console and a high end gaming PC connected and I was not prepared for the results. Coming from a high end 4k monitor, I didn't think it would look that different but I was completely wrong especially on the console. Not only was console gaming buttery smooth with the 120hz refresh rate but the picture quality was a million times better! All my console games looked so good I was actually mad that I had already finished some of the games on the monitor and not experienced the games on this TV. Now for a couple criticisms. I love everything about the remote except the ""ok"" button. Although I appreciate the fact that it's a scroll wheel, it's very small and recessed so it's not easy to press. I also feel like that's going to be the first thing that fails and then I won't have a remote because that's the main button. Secondly is the fact that the apps don't automatically update in the background. They seem to update very frequently which I appreciate but every time they do, I get a prompt that says there is a new version. Then I have to click update, go to the app center, wait for the update, then open the app. Overall, the is by far the best TV I've ever owned. Watching TV on the other TVs in my house just doesn't have the same feel and now I'm trying to find reasons to replace them with more LG C3 TVs!",5,3,

Amongst many benefits: no backlight bleeding/blooming, perfect blacks, infinite contrast, near instantaneous refresh rates - makes visual details as perfect as it can be. These LG OLEDs are the gold standard when it comes to reasonably priced OLEDs for your home. The C3 is no different - if anything is improves upon the brightness from its processors which is arguably one of the downsides of OLED panels. There are some negatives: the biggest being that there needs some (small) calibrations needed to perfect the visual experience out of the box. Also there are ADs - but these can be disabled in the settings. Overall, the negatives do not take away from the AMAZING visual experience that these LG OLEDs offer.

I'm aware there is two sound settings for mounted or standing and it changed nothing. Still had to keep it a bit higher. Outside of that it has been going strong. The picture quality 10/10 and even though I have to turn it up a bit more in volume than the other TV it is pretty solid. Same smart TV which I have no issues with. It runs way cooler than your standard Led TV as well which is a plus. Especially when you live in a hotter climate. I still highly recommend for anyone whether in a hot climate or not.

I waited a few years before buying a large 75""+ plus TV. I waited for a picture crispness,.contrast and color separation that wowed me. I was first surprised by the packaging. I am a 65 year old male. When the 6' 4"" long box was delivered. I was intimidated by the overall size. Having set up a few flat screens, I opted for self installation. When.the box arrived.the box looked gigantic. For the moment, I thought I wished.I purchased installation upon purchase. Like man does, I started to unpack it without reading the instructions. It was packed very well, nothing protected from damaged unless dropped or layed flat. The Styrofoam protecting the TV was sectionally disassembled leaving the TV upright in.yet another styro tray.

The picture quality is stunning, and the sound is top-notch, making it probably the best TV I've ever owned. One of the standout features is its incredibly slim design, making it look sleek and modern in my living room. Setting it up was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is, which makes moving it around a lot easier. Another feature that impressed me is the great wire management system at the back. It keeps all the cables organized and out of sight, creating a clean and clutter-free setup. The overall viewing experience is just amazing, and it has definitely enhanced my movie nights and gaming sessions. The OLED technology truly brings the colors to life, offering deep blacks and vibrant hues that make everything on the screen look lifelike. Whether it's watching movies, sports, or playing games, the LG C3 delivers an immersive experience like no other.

Using the included pedestal stand. It seems a bit wobbly even with all the screws re-hand tightened after a week. With regard to colors and contrast, black is very black. The startup for the show Black Mirror makes the crack appear to be very real because the pixel control is so extreme. Contrast and color control was excellent using the latest Top Gun movie as the test. Remote takes getting used to as it is too fancy for its own good with all of the selections that can be made using a point/click arrow, a click wheel as well as the traditional up/down press of the main button. I am using the cable remote for control of channels/volume/power. Once the TV parameters were set up, I put the LG remote in a drawer. Also have it hardwired to the internet but have spent only minimal time looking at the LG channel viewing options available. The set updates automatically and lets you know when you power up the next time. Without a soundbar, the audio is more than passable for traditional shows and sports. Movies not so much. It was simple to attach to an LG S95QR soundbar. I use a 4k cable box to connect to the soundbar and then to the TV through the eARC connection.",5,0,

Not surprisingly, the improvement in picture quality is fantastic. My wife and I are noticing many new details in movies we watched before on our old TV. As expected, colors are vivid, blacks are very black, and lots of details are revealed in shadows that we never saw with our old TV. This TV is easy to unbox and set up. After connecting it to our home audio system, the experience is every bit as good as being in a movie theater. The built in speakers provide plenty of volume, but bass tones are nonexistent unless you use a sound bar or AV audio system for sound. Not everything is great about this TV. The owners manual, which you can online obtain online is the worst I have ever seen. Not only does it not show you the way to connect peripherals like a sound system, cable box, or sound bar to this set but you largely have to figure out on your own how to adjust the many features on this TV. I’m still unable to figure out how to use Bluetooth to show photos from my iPad on the TVscreen. The remote control is not a universal remote and controls only the TV. At this price point LG should have provided a learning, universal remote. The “magic” pointer is incredibly annoying and offers no real advantage to using the wheel on the remote for navigation. Another annoyance is the TV will not remember its last configuration. So, for example, if you watch cable TV and turn the set off, when you turn the set back on, it takes you back to the Home Screen where you have to make multiple clicks to get back to cable TV. The TV has an OLED panel care option to do pixel cleaning to prevent burn in. You can configure it to do pixel cleaning when the set gets turned off, but you have to reselect it in the general settings menu every single time. There is no way to configure the TV to routinely do pixel cleaning. Overall, this is a very nice TV with beautiful picture quality. It falls very short of being a great TV, though, due to its many shortcomings, some of which are mentioned above. Many of these, I would think, could be fixed with a software update and a much more detailed owner’s manual, and I sincerely hope LG will do this.",4,0,

https://www.target.com/p/ge-jes1460dsbb-1-4-cu-ft-black-counter-top-microwave/-/A-90238388,Excellent quality,John Jwjczko,"This is a great microwave, and quite a powerhouse for its modest profile. It heats food and drink fast, and is well made: good design, made of quality parts, and assembled properly with certain quality assurance methods in place. It is a sturdy unit that doesn’t seem the least bit chintzy or cheap — this microwave was not made with the bottom dollar in mind. It has sensors to ensure proper cooking and cook times, a convenient timer, and a clock. I especially appreciate the express cook one-button time cook 1-6 for 1 to 6 minutes of cooking, and the button to add 30-seconds to the cook time is extremely handy, too. I use it frequently, more so than I ever would’ve expected to, and I really enjoy and appreciate the convenience it brings by its thoughtful design by people who are obviously forward-thinking and have the consumer in mind. I would recommend this microwave to anyone who thinks product longevity is more important than just getting the job done as cheaply as possible and prefers lasting products to those that are made to be thrown out and replaced when the cheap components quickly fail. The same folks who would rather pay a little more for good quality and utility of an appliance that will last nearly a lifetime, as opposed to the least expensive option that still looks modern and in-style, but the enamel chips after a month of use and causes arcing for most of its service life… *cough*cough*I’m looking at you, Emerson!

So I wanted to get another one just like it but I had a difficult time finding one without having to order it and wait 2 weeks to come in. So a salesman at an appliance store talked me into buying a Danby. It just didn’t preform like my old GE so I asked for a refund. Fortunately, the manager allowed me to use the Danby until the GE unit came in so I ordered it and what a difference between the Danby and the new GE. I’m so glad that I got it.

It satisfied all of my requirements for size, inside space, and cooking power, it has the ease-of-use options I wanted (eg., quick start cooking for 1-6 minutes, ""add 30 seconds""). Most importantly for me, it has a humidity sensor that allows me to easily cook potatoes (my go-to food item) and other foods with the push of one button. Most other low-cost microwaves require you to enter the ""number of potatoes"" after pressing the potato button, and an often-inaccurate cooking time is then calculated by the microwave (since it doesn't know whether you're cooking mammoth or tiny potatoes). This microwave just senses the humidity to determine when the potatoes (or popcorn or leftovers) are ready. That's my kind of cooking!",5,0,

It's finish on the outside is slightly different than the other one, so I clean off fingerprints more often, but that's easy enough to do! grew up knowing that GE made good appliances and I'm thrilled that they still are.

I'm counting on the reliability of the GE name and the fact that this item is fairly comparable to the older model, for the new microwave to be as durable (as today's resources and standards seem to allow). The door of the new model is so much lighter, I already see the need to be more delicate with handling, especially when closing it. The two latches that lock the door are made of plastic and seem flimsy. If not careful to align the door properly, the top latch pulls closed before the bottom, which seems to put more pressure on the plastic piece as the bottom of the door bends slightly outward.

The explanation given in the manual is the shorter cord is a safety feature so folks don't trip over the cord. Get real!! All the shorter cord does is make it necessary in many if not most cases for the consumer to use an extension cord, which is potentially much more dangerous.

I am hoping that this new one works as good as that previous model. I noticed right at the start that this new one appears and feels to be made with much thinner outer shell and the latch seems a bit weak. So far, for the short time I've had it, seems to work for my needs as it should and it's a little faster. It's a small amount of watts more than the previous model so faster is a good sign. Overall I feel it's comparable to others in it's class and would recommend it. Only time will tell how well it will hold up to usage.",4,0,

https://www.target.com/p/ge-jes1460dsbb-1-4-cu-ft-black-counter-top-microwave/-/A-90238388,The Old One Worked Better,whathasnotbeenused,I am a bit confused with this microwave. We actually purchased this particular microwave because it was very nearly the same product we previously owned. However our previous microwave was over 20 years old and was making noises so we thought it probably should be replaced. So we decided to stick with GE and something as similar as possible to what we had originally. However this microwave takes longer to heat things than the older one did. It seems to need preheat time. When you microwave something the first time it is hot enough or done but if you then microwave a second item immediately at the same time and power level it seems ok. Simple things I used to microwave in the older one got hot much quicker but I have to keep putting things back in the new one. I am using the same time and power levels I have always used. So I am not sold on this new one but I guess it is what I now have. Also the older model had a more textured exterior which looked nicer while this slick exterior looks cheap.,2,0,

We are very disappointed that you dropped the wattage. Also, our power went off briefly then came right back on, and the clock had to be reset.

A week ago it began intermittently displaying the power failure (PF) code for no reason, but it continued to work. Then a few days later, in the middle of heating up a frozen meal, it just stopped suddenly as though there had been a power outage. No unusual sound or burning odor as others had experienced. However, testing the outlet showed it wasn't a power outage--the microwave had simply died. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in and trying an alternate power outlet to no avail. My previous microwave had lasted over 15 years, so I am extremely disappointed that this one would die after just over two years of light use; it still looks brand new! Because it's past the one-year warranty, I assume I have no recourse. Will never buy a GE appliance of any type again.",1,0,

Now there is just Reheat, no options for what you are heating or how much. The manual claims the microwave can sense when the food is ready, I strongly disagree. I have ruined several items using the Reheat mode, it gets too hot and goes too long. Now I have to find the right balance of Time Cook and Power Level just to reheat items. I'm very disappointed.

We needed to replace our smaller, 1 cf unit. This GE unit fits into the same smaller space and yet provides 1.4 cf (a 40% increase). It has simpler controls than our last unit. We especially like the +30 sec and 1-touch controls. For setting power, we no longer have to repeatedly push the Power Level button, a big annoyance with our prior unit. For example, to get level 3 on the old unit, we needed to press the PL button 8 times in a row! On this unit, we press the PL button and ""3""; much simpler. We also like the easy way to choose between defrost by weight or time. Bags of popcorn are perfectly popped with the Popcorn button. We don't really use many of the ""sensor"" features. We've tried a few, but find it more accurate to set our own power levels and times, based upon past experience with the foods and quantities we prepare. We like this unit so much that we are even considering replacing our larger 2+ cf unit to be a similar model with identical controls. The only missing feature, which we liked in our prior smaller unit, is the ""inverter"" power operation, which we think works better than cycling full power on/off to simulate lower power levels.",4,0,

I will be contacting customer service soon if it doesn't.,3,0,

It is quite a bit larger than I (as a retired widowed Senior Citizen) living by myself needed. If you want 1100 watt power you have to get the equipment you need. Since smaller apt size microwave do not come in 1100 watt power but only 900 watt. The only other problem I have is when it is running it makes noises that are irritating and somewhat alarming like it going to quit or blow up. I am trying to get use to using the reheat button. It really heats up leftover soups/ canned spaghetti etc. a little too much. I do have to watch it closely to make sure it doesn't boil over or gets too hot it starts to boil.,4,0,

It does everything a microwave should, and offers some neat extras like the 30-second button and the one-touch feature (i.e., hit the ""1"" and it starts a 1-minute cycle, hit ""2"" for a 2-minute cycle, etc.) Didn't realize how much I would appreciate that time-saver.There are probably others I haven't discovered yet, but this alone makes it worth the purchase price.",5,0,

Turns out this one is not nearly as good. The first one of these I bought had legs/base of different heights so it sat crooked (and could be rocked) and made a very loud motor noise when in use (the noise lessened if I lifted up the corner so it sat flat). I returned that one and I bought another of the same model. The new one is only slightly crooked in how it sits on the shelf and does not make the terrible noise the other did. However, I use the defrost function quite a bit and this works poorly. About half way through the defrost time it starts beeping and saying ""burn"" even though nothing is burning. So I have to hit pause, wait a few seconds, and then hit start again, and it finishes defrosting. It's very annoying to have to babysit my microwave every time I want to defrost anything.",2,0,

Heating up and cooking is identical to the Kenmore. But I like a few of the other feature. Instead of hitting the time cook button, you can hit the number buttons for each minute and it will start automatically or you can hit the time cook , punch in the time and hit start.

This new microwave oven is a replacement for GE Model JES1451DN1BB which quit on me a couple of days ago. The former oven was purchased as a floor model and didn't last as long as I had hoped - about 4-5 years. The first problem was that the turntable would continue to rotate when the oven door was open. This went on for about a year. While it worked, I was very happy with it. It was easy to use and heated food well; it also had sensor cooking. My new oven is very similar, but without sensor cooking. GE has many similar model numbers which, I guess, confused me. I assumed that the new model was simply an update of the old. This isn't too much of a problem as I didn't use the sensor feature often. What I really like is the high power express cook and the ""add 30 seconds"" functions. I'm hoping that they work as well in my new GE as they did in the old one. I think that anyone wanting a simple-to-use microwave that heats foods evenly and has the aforementioned features at a good price will not go wrong with Model JES1460DS3BB (I searched without the ""3"" in the model number).",4,0,

It functions well but I have one issue: door does not appear to be flush with oven front face. When I press my finger around outer door near the glass, I hear a click more than half-way around the part of the door above, to the side and below the glass. This does not seem normal to me since all previous microwaves I have operated and/or owned, did not make a clicking sound and the plastic being very firm could not move in this manner. Will be contacting GE online as soon as I complete this review. This observation may not be cause for alarm but I need to find out if microwave door actually seals against the microwave of if there is a gap which would permit microwave energy to escape. This issue may or may not exist with other microwave ovens of the same model and that is something I would like to know.",4,0,

https://www.target.com/p/ge-jes1460dsbb-1-4-cu-ft-black-counter-top-microwave/-/A-90238388,GE is my favorite,NitPicky,"I bought this microwave to replace a previous GE that I purchase about 10 years ago. I bought the floor model at Walmart because that was the last one they had left. Even at that, it lasted a long time. It was a good microwave up until rust started forming at the inside corner of the door. I was able to cover it with electrical tape for a long time and it kept going for an extra two or three years. Finally, however, the area started getting hot and you could hear crackling sounds when in use. The main reason that I did not want to get a new one is because my old one had a mute setting for the beeper. There are few microwaves that offer this feature. There is another GE model which does but, it's a much bigger unit that does not fit well in my space. So, I had to choose between picking a different brand with the ""mute beeper"" feature or to choose another, small GE without that feature. Because I really like GE, I chose to learn to live with the beeper. While I REALLY wish that I could turn it off, the only time it really bothers me is when I walk away from something and then it constantly reminds me with intermittent beeps. Otherwise, it's a good microwave that has all of the same features of my old one and it works well and as expected. Sadly, I hope it doesn't last for ten years, though, as I am always on the lookout for a smaller GE with the mute beeper option.",4,0,

Some of the features are different. For example with the older I was able to adjust the power level while an item was cooking -- unfortunately not so with this model -- ya have to stop the cooking, re-enter the cooking time (if you remember where it left off) with the new power level -- it's a hastle. The only improvement that I have seen so far is that with extended usage at high power, occasionally the unit will go to a lower power level automatically, I guess that saves the unit from cooking itself out of existence like my old one did finally (but I had the old one for over 10 years) -- I hope this new one lasts as long.",4,0,

I wanted a white one that wasn't expensive, was large enough with a rotating dish, and wasn't complicated to use. This is large enough and strong enough for what we do (I do not and will never, cook meat or items from scratch in a microwave, mostly reheat and maybe baked potatoes). My biggest compliant is that the reheat button is complicated, if you hit it, it just starts working with no idea what level and how long it will run. We had to download the instructions from the main website and keep it behind the machine. I would've preferred having a reheat button to push and put how many minutes instead of having to fill out layers of buttons before hitting reheat. Regardless, I just hit time and put in how many seconds and it is amazing how few seconds it takes to warm something (auto set on high for TIME).",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/ge-jes1460dsbb-1-4-cu-ft-black-counter-top-microwave/-/A-90238388,"Works well, but a little underpowered",emelvy,"After three months' use I find this microwave does the jobs I give it. However, (1) it often takes longer than my former Sharp Carousel oven (that lasted 23 years!) which had the same wattage rating. For example, if I want to cook a potato (white or sweet, large or small) and press the ""Potato"" button, it is not done when the oven signifies ""End"". I have to repeat the operation to have the potato fully cooked. Other foods also take longer to cook or re-heat than the previous oven did. I conclude that either this oven is underpowered or else the pre-set programs are incorrectly calibrated. (2). The legend on the buttons is hard to read -- the lettering should be larger and not shown on a gray background. It might also help to position the most frequently-used buttons (like Reheat or Cancel) in a more prominent place, not merely lined up under a group of unrelated buttons.",4,0,

Decided to re-think my choice and wound up with this GE. Boy, am I glad I did! I really love this microwave so far! Lots of cool cooking features. The door opens easily, meaning you don't have to hold it to keep it from walking backwards every time you push the door button. Love the kitchen timer feature that can be used to time something even while you are cooking something else in the microwave. Seems quite a bit quieter than my old one and also seems much sturdier than the one I returned. All in all, very satisfied with this purchase.",5,0,

No reason to think that this one won't last just as long. A couple improvements this one has that the old one didn't are: 1) Add 30 Sec, and 2) Reheat. The only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars is that the door could use additional reinforcements to keep it from flexing. If you push the door closed from any point just above the midpoint, the door doesn't want to latch. This is because the door has flexed/twisted to the point that the lower latch is waiting for the door to move far enough to engage. Not a biggie, but I think the design could be adjusted to eliminate this problem with very little cost involved. I would have happily paid a few dollars more to avoid this issue.",4,0,

The microwave that just died was the same make and model...just the updated version. I think it says a lot that we bought the same exact microwave. We like it that much. Our favorite features are the popcorn button (which somehow senses how much the popcorn has popped and adjusted remaining time accordingly) and the ""add 30 seconds"" button. We also like the quick start feature where you press one digit between 1 and 3 and it automatically starts cooking for that many minutes. My only complaint is that the microwave doesn't appear to be made to last. Our last one lasted about 3 years. We took it in to be repaired at an appliance store. It was fixed but then started acting up again a year later. It was a problem with the door that caused the microwave to run every time we closed the door, with our without food inside, without us pressing any buttons.

This one seemed the best price for the money. We had just purchased another GE product a few years before and liked it as well. This microwave was the closest to the features we had in a previous microwave and decided between the price, the GE brand and the features this was the one to try. To date, it has not disappointed us in usage. We actually like this one better than our previous microwave. I will say that I am only expecting about 2 or three years of use from this unit, as that is what I was able to get from our previous couple of microwaves. They do not seem to be built as well as microwaves from 20 or 30 years ago.",4,0,

Most of the others that were this price or cheaper look like little toys that would break very easily. So far in this microwave has done a great job. Really like it.

The older models all had a problem with the open control in that they eventually broke being hinged on one side. this new unit has a straight in push that is wobbly and squeaks when pushed in to open door and often sticks in the in position ,but does pop out when door is closed. We have been very happy with our GE microwaves but surely a better way can be found to open the door in place of the current flimsey opener.

For those of you who don't know, it's almost the exact same microwave. the only difference is the JES1460DS2BB has 2 more (Chicken & Fish) sensor cook modes. The 1.4cf capacity is more than big enough to cook anything I would be cooking & the 1100 watts is more than adequate to not just cook items quickly (PL 10), but it will also reheat leftovers (from the fridge) at a lower power level (Try a slice of pizza on PL 8 for 45 seconds.

Time Cook & enter time followed by Power Level (if not full), then just do it again & press Start. I did some comparison shopping online b4 going to buy a microwave for us & I ended up bringing 3 different microwaves home. Then I happened to see this one that looks so much like the one we were replacing (Don't slam the door. It will wear out the latch/lock mechanism b4 its time. & a heavier turntable will kill your motor.) & I bought & brought it home 2. Needless 2 say my senior aged (doesn't like alot of change) mother wanted to keep the GE, but she was willing to read the manuals on the others. Not only was the GE way easier to understand & use, it was also the only one that had the set & use timer function while still cooking or begin cooking something while the timer is being used. Either way, one function will not interfere with the other. Not one other microwave I looked into online had this fantastic feature. What more can I say? Buy one if U r on the hunt for a microwave. U won't regret it. Now let's go back to my beginning. What I didn't say was when I purchased this microwave. Although it was only 2 days ago, 9/29/15, I know I can testify to how well it will perform with complete confidence. Oh yeah. Inverter technology on this unit woul have earned it an excellent review on its features aspect.",5,0,

I replaced our old one because of the infamous interior flaking paint problem. I intend to prep and paint it and use it for a backup oven. Hopefully this paint problem will be resolved soon. I know a lot of sales for GE are lost because of this long on going problem. We like the features of the oven however, especially the minute and half minute express cook feature. The old oven we had was very dependable. We have only used the new one for two days, so do not know if this one will match the dependability of the old oven. The new microwave's door opener would only get a one star rating from me. Very difficult to open unless pushed in one exact spot, and then still pushes hard.

This model was the replacement, and since I didn't have a receipt I did end up paying more than half the price. I noticed this oven had a bit of a sticky door latch after a few days of use. When I opened the door the big door button in front didn't jump out to the right position. I never saw a problem with the light bulb inside, but it went out a couple of days ago, and I've got an appointment with the GE repair people in couple of days.

We unplugged the unit, waited 15 seconds and plugged it back in, with the same results. We owned a similar GE microwave for 11 years before the magnetron went out, and we were very satisfied with its performance. We're surprised this defective unit made it through GE quality control. We returned it to the store without any issues, and informed them of the problem. One option presented to us was to have GE make a service call to repair the unit under warranty, but we didn't want the hassle of staying home waiting for the repair truck, and wondering whether they would have the replacement part. So if you buy this model, just stay close to it the first few times you heat something, and don't put anything on the sides of the cabinet until you feel it's operating correctly.",2,0,

Shining crome on my motorcycle is wonderful. No streaking and dries quickly. I have used it to clean my dirty hands when no other means is available. I wouldn't use it on clear plastic lens. I time it can degrade the plastic.,5,0,

We had built a new house and the master bedroom had the very lightest beige carpet. I needed a pedicure and gathered up what I needed to get started. I chose a dark wine/brown polish and had polished one nail when the phone rang. I jumped up and hit the open bottle and polish went everywhere. Startled, I grabbed the polish remover, poured it on the carpet and tried to get the mess up. Now I had a 15 inch circle that was horrible. I knew I was in big trouble, would probably have to replace the new carpet. I ran and Googled what to do. Someone said use Windex. Windex? Would Windex clean up my mess? I doubted it but I was in a panic. I ran and got the Windex along with a new roll of paper towels. I sprayed the wide wine colored circle really well and let it soak in for about a minute. Then I started blotting with some force. I had to spray it twice and blot well, and in just a few minutes the carpet looked just like new. I was ecstatic. I would never have believed it would work but I needed help and it did not let me down. Thank you Windex!",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/doritos-nacho-cheese-flavored-tortilla-chips-14-5oz/-/A-13319564,why crushed chips,Dorito man,ok the reason why I review this product as a % star is because of the taste but as far as the chips they are a 0 star its because they are all crushed and in crumbs because they don't care when they stock them they try to get as many on the shelf as possible so when they fill the shelf to the end the push the bags back as hard as they can to fit more on there target needs to stock it instead of the delivery guy because they will put on as much as they can its not us they care about they just want to sell as many as they can which is fine just make room for more dont crush the custumes product if they do just return it they will learn,5,3,

They wouldn't brush out, but they would polish out with a cleaning at the dental office. I was puzzled because I've never had stains before. I changed my diet, made sure to brush my teeth after coffee - nothing seemed to help - stains always started reappearing around 5 months from my last cleaning. Then I switched back to my favorite toothpaste - this one! I've only been using it about a month, but the stains have virtually disappeared without a professional cleaning.

I was stoked to see what new features they had added and new items I could destroy people with. Unfortunately, I feel like Diddy Kong Racing is still a far better game (yes, a Nintendo 64 game is better than this). This struggles with the classic issues MarioKart has always had. Computers inexplicably catching up and passing you at unrealistic speeds at the worst possible moments. The same old courses with ""updates."" To their defense, they did add a new battle mode that's all the rage. On the back of the case, it says you can hold two items for double the firepower like it's some kind of new feature. Nope, it just means you can hold two items at once, and fire them one at a time. Honestly, I feel like Nintendo has lost their imagination and needs to add some features that are actually new. The beset games for the Switch are non-Nintendo games and are made by outside developers. Pros, good graphics.",1,17,

I was a little intimidated and apprehensive to use the Ninja Woodfire Outdoor Grill when I first got it but, I am learning how to use all of it's functions and actually enjoying our new level of cooking. This outdoor oven is very versatile. Smoker, broiler, baker, dehydrator and roaster all in one appliance makes it the favorite outdoor appliance. The front control panel is easy to see and use. You only need to change the cooking function, temperature, time and if you want the woodfire flavor smoke added to your cooking choice. The pizza setting has extra custom settings to use, which includes what type of pizza you are cooking (frozen, thin crust, etc.) and will preheat the pizza stone for you so the crust comes out perfect each time! I love how easy the instruction book is to read and follow. It includes basic recipes for beginners to help ease into the outdoor oven. The package also included a pack of woodfire pellets. The all-purpose blend flavor gave our roast a mild woodfire flavor and turned our mac n cheese flavor into the most flavorful mac n cheese we have ever had! The smoker feature is the best feature in my opinion! The oven is easy to clean and several parts are dishwasher safe. I am purchasing the adjustable table, attachable side table and oven cover to make it easier to keep outside and clean from the outdoor elements.",5,0,

Didn't take too long to preheat while I made the pizza and the instructions were super easy to understand. What I found the most amazing having a pizza done in less then 6 minutes that came out just perfect and delicious!!! I'm so impressed with this unit I plan on using it often in my outdoor kitchen. I do wish it had handles to move around easier but it's not that big of a deal as it's not heavy so it's easy enough to move around. Can't wait to make my next meal in this awesome unit!!!,5,2,

I prepared several medium size pizzas and then started cooking and eating. They come out nice and crispy, fully cooked and in only five minutes. Of course, depending on the type of pizza and the time it has been on, you will need to adjust the temperature and the time so they dońt burn. We were cooking and eating at the same time to eat them as they were coming out of the oven. It comes with the pizza stone and a frame, roasting rack, pellet scoop, and pan. This is an amazing oven. You can cook almost anything in it. Chicken, ribs, roast, etc. It is very well made. Not to heavy so you can move it around. The metal door is good but i would like it to be glass so you can look inside, especially when making pizza to make sure it does not burn. Can’t wait to make many other foods in it.

If you use the would chips you will get a mesquite or smoked flaver. But if you use the chips you have to let them burn out, so if you use them, you have to wait to they burn out so you can cover it.

We used a traditional kitchen oven to create our pizzas, and while that was bearable, we were looking for an upgrade to our pizza game. This Ninja Woodfire Oven is quite literally my favorite pickup of the year so far. There's no way to really describe how different it makes them other than you'd have to see it for yourself. Temps go up to 700° F which is insanely hot for a consumer electric oven, cooks evenly and quickly, and brings our homemade foods like our pizzas to the next level. I attached a couple images with my review, the pictures of the pizza were first attempts at using the oven on the Neapolitan setting. They came out beautifully, and they tasted like they came from a restaurant. Getting the oven up to temperature doesn't take long at all, and it only takes a couple minutes to cook your pizza, no turns needed. We like our pizzas just a bit on the burnt side, so we left ours in for another minute (after 3 minutes), and made a great ""coal-fired"" style similar to what you would find at a pizza shop that uses extremely hot ovens. There's a variety of modes for any type of food that you'd want to cook, and also an area to add wood pellets to add a ""smoky"" flavor to whatever you want. We have been using this oven for the past week with no complaints or flaws that come in our way. It's very simple to use, comes with potential recipies to use with it, works and operates how you think it should, and is easy to move, so going to a friend's house for a backyard cook, or for storage, is easy to do. We plan on getting the stand and cover that's for purchase so we can keep it outside instead of bringing it in every time. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and very happy with this oven, and it brought my pizza-making skills to the next level with no effort.",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/igloo-imx-24qt-cooler-meteorite/-/A-87378961,Better than I hoped,Bob,"I prechilled the cooler by putting two frozen gallon jugs in it for a day. Then I put two new frozen jugs in and checked it each day. For the first five days the cooler stayed at 34 degrees and the ice in the jugs slowly melted. Today is day six and the ice is almost gone, but the cooler is still at 37 degrees. This was done with a 68 degree ambient temperature. I figure if the cooler is packed with ice to start it should be good for at least three days in the hot weather. Not bad for less than $100.

https://www.target.com/p/igloo-imx-24qt-cooler-meteorite/-/A-87378961,It's Okay!,,"I only gave this cooler 2 stars because it won't hold ice more than 2 days and the cable on the drain plug makes it hard to get the plug off or back on and the first week I had it, it broke off the plug so now no safety cable on the plug. I would give the over all look of this cooler a 5, this thing looks tough and rigid and it really is for the most part. I like the what I call the sandwhich basket it comes with as well to store food to keep cold and dry. I like the rubber latches, they strap the lid down great and keep it closed, I noticed Yeti did away this and not sure why because it's a great feature so great job igloo. I also like that you can lock the cooler to keep people from taking you drinks or food. The metal carry handel is great, I loaded this up with half case of waters and two bags of ice and could carry it just fine with the ridgid handle on this cooler. I hate this will not keep ice any longer than it really can but facts are facts and I need a cooler that can at the very least keep ice for 4-5 days and 2 days is all you are getting out of this one unless I got a lemon.

https://www.target.com/p/igloo-imx-24qt-cooler-meteorite/-/A-87378961,Cooler review,Andrewp829,Big frame on the outside but not as much space on the inside of the cooler thought it was gonna have more space to fit beers water etc once u pour ice inside not too much could be fit inside for the size of the cooler. Like the bottle opener and cup holders on top. Cooler is advertised as not being heavy once is full nit true cooler is pretty heavy and ice retention doesn’t last 4 days ice was melted the very next day. It’s my first weekend using it so I’ll see how this weekend goes but so far not to impressed with the cooler.,3,0,

https://www.target.com/p/igloo-imx-24qt-cooler-meteorite/-/A-87378961,Solid cooler but not prefect,Crow,"The inside is much smaller than you would expect considering how big and bulky the outside is. The handle sticks out on the sides enough to take up even more extra space in my car. The grip is comfortable though, so it's got that going on at least. Carrying it can be a bit awkward but that's to be expected of any cooler with these dimensions. I only use the handle to lift it and carry it on my shoulder instead even when fully loaded. Quality wise, my only complaint is the seal was cut slightly shorter than it should be so there's a small section it doesn't cover. Other than that, it's very well made and sturdy enough to sit or stand on (185lbs here). Performance has been good so far. I completely filled it with cold food and four 4x6x0.5in ice packs and two quart sized ice cubes and the big ice cubes didn't fully melt after 4 days. The cooler was outside in the shade during 70-80° days while camping. I also used it to bring back several frozen ice packs back home with the other 2/3-1/2 of the volume being cold beers. The cooler was in my trunk for about 30hrs with direct sunlight hitting it at around 80° weather. When I got home, the ice packs were halfway melted, but 2 beer bottles were partially frozen, and the beer can I cracked open was 33.6° cold. Like I said, it's got its quirks but preforms solidly, particularly for the price. Due to the small capacity, I'm replacing it with a bigger cooler from another brand so that my gf and I can take more food and drinks when camping. This one is now mainly for when I camp alone, day trips, or freshwater fishing (plus it's the perfect size to sit). Plus, I actually love the look of it!",4,2,

I found this was the best bang for your buck. Has many great built in features that come in handy. I like the durability and design of it. Can stand on it no problem and has no flex in the lid. One draw back I will say is the size. It’s a little awkward to carry fully loaded with the handle as it is. Wish to maybe have seen a few handles on the side like the IMX 70.

It is well made providing extended use for trips if/when needed. Due to the nature of the cooler to keep items colder for those extended periods, it is thick and once ice & items, such as beverages and food, are added it does increase the weight of the cooler substantially. That is not an issue with us because it performs as we expected and serves exactly as desired and stated by IGLOO. The seal is secure while also being easy to open and close.

https://www.target.com/p/igloo-imx-24qt-cooler-meteorite/-/A-87378961,Very happy with this cooler,,I did a lot of research on various high end coolers before I purchased this one. I’m very happy with my decision to purchase the IMX. We took it on vacation to Zion and it kept everything cold on our 500 mile drive out and the original ice lasted 2 1/2 days and would have lasted longer if I didn’t drain it and added more ice. This was constantly in use with opening and closing and shuffling around to get what we wanted out of it. The basket is a great feature and kept fruit and bars out of the ice and also kept the contents from getting smashed while moving. I can’t say enough good things about this cooler and I’m definitely going to invest in getting the larger one as well.,5,0,
