Ive got more dust in and around my kitchen trash bin because a lot of the dust is light enough to float away. Cleaning the filters generates more dust and wastes water.

I bought mine at the Big Box S club store (It was less and had the cover and pizza peel inc). Also note the price of these just dropped Everywhere (03-10-24)! Could there be a new model on the horizon?
This oven made fabulous pizza out of the Box (Heating it on Max for 30 min before starting Pizza setting). We got the take and bake pizza from California Pizza Kitchen for $8, Used the Neapolitan setting (with and without smoke depending on diners preference) and pulled it at 3 min or less getting a little edge char but the perfect crunchy base crust, melted but not burned cheese, and crispy edged pepperoni. We're not new to pizza ovens having had the Ooni gas oven for a few years but their volt(?) was more than I wanted to pay. This electric oven was as good as the gas version without the terror of an inferno that one has with early uses of the gas oven as well as no constant turning and babying the pizza. In fact you can't baby the pizza.. the door is closed and there's NO window!
We usually use our own dough and make our pizzas from scratch so we'll see how those are, but I'm expecting it will be great, and so much easier to do than before. Of course I'm also anxious to try the smoking feature etc and will update if there's anything to say about those.",5,0,0.157131094,0.509090909,258.0,4.6,0.486998556998557,1,41

UI upgrades are nice and welcome. Only downside is forced ads that you can't turn off completely and 'ad tracking' among some other settings being enabled by default, that you have to dig in menus to disable. I don't use much apps on the TV as is but its annoying.

That excitement was short lived however.
It is about the most frustrating piece of equipment I've ever dealt with. The days of a printer that just PRINTS are apparently in the rear view mirror, everything with this thing was a hassle.
Set up, connecting to WiFi, connecting to laptop- you basically HAVE to use HPs ridiculous, slow, and glitchy app in order for it to ""work"".

This printer is(was) an absolute trash bag NIGHTMARE.
It worked fine about half the time, but required constant fussing with even then.
The other half the time it just didn't. :(
No reason given, just an error as I'm frantically trying to print labels to mail my products out.
Connected to WiFi, connected to phone/computer, it just says ""naaaaah"".
Guessing it has to do with the sleep mode that you can't turn off, but who knows? (Side note- who wants a dang sleep mode?! I don't care of it uses a little power to work when I want, sheesh!)

The instant ink subscription seems like a good deal at first, until you realize you're paying by pages you actually print, NOT for the ink.
After about the 100th time of me spending 45 mins trying to print a UPS label and not being able to for exactly zero reason, this piece of crap found out the hard way.
I quietly and calmly unplugged it, carried it gently out on the front porch of my store, and hulk smashed it down the solid stone steps into the parking lot. More glass in there than I thought. 

Hate to have wasted money, but it felt pretty good to office space this worthless piece of trash. I low-key wish I could put it back together so I could smash it again, I HATE THIS THING!
H A T E H A T E H A T E H A T E H A T E H A T E
I'll never, EVER, buy another HP product.
Not a printer, not a laptop, not even a pack of paper. I hope all the bad things of the world happen to whoever invented this particular piece of crap. Stub your toe forever, lose your wallet, your keys, have diarrhea. Blegh
I'm still so angry I'm vibrating, and now I get to go buy another printer so I can send out my clients purchases. Yay.",1,0,-0.064300711,0.530943152,399.0,4.1,0.594556277,1,59

The camera is apparently a lot better than the S10 (with a 100x zoom), but I haven't played with it much. I have noticed that photos show greater detail in the texture of things with this camera.  The S22 Ultra has a variable refresh rate, which is designed to save on battery, but I haven't really noticed my battery lasing longer than usual.

It makes for easy in and out of whatever, and I can carry it with one hand. I don't usually latch the latches and it works amazing. Best cooler on the market for hot summers.

Just for reference: the Yeti will hold ice for most of a work day, inside my truck, with ice turned to cool water by the end of day. The igloos will last 2 days (it will be ice and water). No cooler will hold ice for 5 days inside of a hot truck in central Texas. I was able to get a 3rd day with my bigger igloo but it wasn't inside my truck, it was in the bed, but getting hammered by the sun. I truly believe the design of this cooler to be the best out there.

I've only had MK8 since August and played maybe a dozen or so times and while I love MK8D for pure nostalgia and clean entertainment, just like I still play MK64, I wouldn't otherwise. It would collect dust and would make me angry that really there's nothing new racing wise. Pickings are slim for games on the switch a few new tracks really would make a huge difference in most people's minds.

The good:
1- My 4 year old finished in 4th in a race 8th overall! No one had to finish playing then do her 3 laps! She didn't give up in frustration halfway through a tournament. No complaining that she lost. The auto acceleration and steering is amazing.
2- Perfect family game.
3- I am not a techie but whoever says the picture quality is pretty much the same is crazy! Or they need a new tv. I have a 4 month old Samsung 1080p tv 42 inches and the picture quality is amazing. Load time is nearly instant.",5,0,0.177391775,0.543545145,267.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,1,145

It was written after I had spent hours trying to fix my printer and was unable to reach anyone at HP. I was ready to throw printer into the garbage but decided to try the Geek Squad as a final attempt. They connected me to the remarkable team of Jennifer and James. Quess what? The printer was fine but my PC was infested with malware, corrupt drivers and mangled programs. They literaly worked for hours to put my computer, printer, and my wife's laptop into good order.  And installed virus and malware protection into our computers. It was expensive but worth it.
My experience made me read a lot of the one-star reviews and I am puzzled. I had no trouble setting up and the printing, scanning and copying went fine. Just that one day the printer stopped working.  A couple of things I learned: The black and color cartriges should be activated every one or two weeks, to prevent ink coagulation. If you won't use the printer for a few months read up on what you can do do to keep print head from dying.

Some of the fetch quests can start to feel old but theres usually an interesting aspect to them thats either funny, sad, or just plain fun. The first 20 hours or so I spent playing were absolutely thrilling. The luster wears off a little bit but the exciting combat and interaction with the characters keeps you going. The conversations you have with your Hogwarts mates are sweet, funny, even touching at times. Youll come to have your favorites among them.

I actually like this foundation, because I prefer a natural appearance.

At first, I wasnt sure if this color was the right fit, but it is perfect for my skin tone.
The texture is velvety, but a little goes a long way.

I was concerned that this felt a little too oily, but it somehow balanced out after a few minutes after application.

I also have oily skin, so my only con is that it felt greasy initially, but my skin absorbed it.

The coverage for me is medium which I like, and this gives my skin an even tone.

The 120Hz refresh rate with our Xbox Series console is a fantastic upgrade, and the gaming-specific features are also easy to navigate and toggle as necessary. The only downsides to this display I have noticed so far is the lack of embedded Google Chromecast or a means to play from our Google Movies & TV library outside of the YouTube app (which often only serves 1080p variants of this content), and that the ""mouse cursor"" feature of the remote being a bit annoying of an adjustment to familiarize with -- it feels like a fun gimmick to some, but I wish I could disable it and just use the arrow buttons to navigate.

We used a traditional kitchen oven to create our pizzas, and while that was bearable, we were looking for an upgrade to our pizza game. This Ninja Woodfire Oven is quite literally my favorite pickup of the year so far. There's no way to really describe how different it makes them other than you'd have to see it for yourself. Temps go up to 700 F which is insanely hot for a consumer electric oven, cooks evenly and quickly, and brings our homemade foods like our pizzas to the next level. I attached a couple images with my review, the pictures of the pizza were first attempts at using the oven on the Neapolitan setting. They came out beautifully, and they tasted like they came from a restaurant. Getting the oven up to temperature doesn't take long at all, and it only takes a couple minutes to cook your pizza, no turns needed. We like our pizzas just a bit on the burnt side, so we left ours in for another minute (after 3 minutes), and made a great ""coal-fired"" style similar to what you would find at a pizza shop that uses extremely hot ovens. There's a variety of modes for any type of food that you'd want to cook, and also an area to add wood pellets to add a ""smoky"" flavor to whatever you want. We have been using this oven for the past week with no complaints or flaws that come in our way. It's very simple to use, comes with potential recipies to use with it, works and operates how you think it should, and is easy to move, so going to a friend's house for a backyard cook, or for storage, is easy to do. We plan on getting the stand and cover that's for purchase so we can keep it outside instead of bringing it in every time. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and very happy with this oven, and it brought my pizza-making skills to the next level with no effort.",5,0,0.202777778,0.578463203,357.0,4.7,0.4839813311688312,1,186

Since the first time I installed Turbo Tax using physical discs, I've had zero problems until this 2023 tax version. My PC is running Windows 10 and just like everytime before I install software, I make sure Windows is updated. Upon startup of the install disc two error messages appeared stating two dll files were missing for necessary installation. Upon investigation I found that the files belonged to Microsoft visual c++ which is a program used by Turbo Tax during creating it and is also part of the Windows system. The problem apparently was that my freshly updated Windows 10 didn't have the same version of Windows Virtual C++ that the 2023 Turbo Tax required. So after an hour or so of searching the internet I found and downloaded three versions of the missing files because the required one was unknown to me. After trying each one, one by one, I finally stumbled on the correct version and Turbo Tax took off and Installed. Besides this being extremely annoying, the whole process was ridiculous for something that should have all the necessary files on the disc for a normal installation. The disc package states it's for Windows 10. Shouldn't have to search the internet for required files especially since I've been running Turbo Tax on the same PC for years.",3,0,0.044444444,0.520767196,244.0,3.4,0.6367559523809524,1,206

I would give the over all look of this cooler a 5, this thing looks tough and rigid and it really is for the most part.

I also like that you can lock the cooler to keep people from taking you drinks or food. The metal carry handel is great, I loaded this up with half case of waters and two bags of ice and could carry it just fine with the ridgid handle on this cooler. I hate this will not keep ice any longer than it really can but facts are facts and I need a cooler that can at the very least keep ice for 4-5 days and 2 days is all you are getting out of this one unless I got a lemon.

Weve been a fan of Ninja products for a while because of their build quality and durability. This outdoor oven is no exception. Its heavy and feels like a premium product. Unboxing is super simple. Just lift the top of the box off. There are a few foam pieces and then you get to the oven. Ours arrived with a small dent on the side which must have happened at the factory since the packaging was intact with no damage. At this price point Id normally dock a star for this but since it in no way affected the functionality Im leaving it as five stars.

The instruction manual is very straightforward and clearly shows how to use the oven. Got it fired up and made pizza last night. My advice is to start on a lower temperature to see how quickly it cooks. I used the recommended setting and time for a Neapolitan crust and it burned. Tried again at a lower temp and it cooked perfectly. Overall really impressed with how these turned out.

We havent tried the wood pellets yet but are looking forward to using this as a smoker when we dont want to fire up our big one.

It has a few wonky design elements that give it a cheaply made tacky appearance. The black screws holding all the pieces together are visible and usually not that noticeable, but this has screws right on the top. Not even any wood grain stickers to try to hide them. The most noticeable is the plastic strips that hold the back pieces snugly together. Theyre an unsightly plastic that runs across the back. They could have at least made it in line with the shelf so its hidden. With these things fixed this is an awesome shelf. The wood grain melamine is clean with a good grain variety. Its a nice dark walnut finish that allows lighter decor to really pop on the shelf. The cube shelf sections are a generous size giving space for taller items like vases or large books.

I'm leaving a review here because I hope others will see it. My old Animal Complete died this morning after 13 years of use. I decided to replace it with this one. What a major mistake.

As others have mentioned, it's hard to get the vacuum head to stay attached. It fell off twice after I heard it click into place. The handle and tools are considerably more flimsy than they were on my old Dyson and the vacuum head is smaller. The dirt cup seems smaller, too.

After using it for about 5 minutes, I smelled burning plastic. When I took a step forward to take a look at it, I stepped on a chunk of molten blue plastic on my carpet. The red brush strip had come off the roller (ripped off somehow, because blue strips from the roller were present as well) and wrapped around the axle of the vacuum head rendering it completely frozen and unable to rotate.

The only positive thing that I can say about it is that for the few minutes it did work without spewing molten plastic, it worked really well for both dirt and pet hair even on places I thought were already clean.

I returned it. Even if the issue with the roller brushes was a defect (and I haven't seen anyone else mention it), the cheap look and feel of this is much different from my old Animal Complete and I'll probably go with another brand.",1,0,0.056777597,0.332873377,255.0,4.4,0.450384024577573,1,255

Starting with the Wii version they added gimmicks (like zero gravity and underwater) that don't really enhance the game in my view, and the courses got a little softer and less exciting (compare Bowser's Castle and Luigi's Mansion to the DS versions). The drifting mechanic is good and the countless kart / wheel combinations can make a big difference in handling. I find it's best to stick to one thing for a while. I like the coin system. The items are a bit too familiar to me at this point.

The printer itself seems ok, but the setup was absolutely exasperating and in my opinion unnecessarily complicated.  And this is from someone who used to do this kind of thing for a living.  It would have been a lot easier if they had included a simple setup guide with the printer.  I am really disappointed in HP for this, as they used to be known as one of the best.

The real issue, though, is after finally getting it set up and running it intermittently goes off line for no reason and the only remedy is to unplug the power cord and plug it back in to reset itself.  Very frustrating if you are on the other side of the house, or also for my wife who is not technical at all.  I have followed all of the HP troubleshooting processes to no avail including their HP print doctor software, which considers unplugging/replugging a suitable solution to the problem!

Strangely enough, it wears all day despite transferring, but I really dont like that it transfers so much when my other foundations dont.

Shade match:
I dont have a shade in this line. I tried 405 and it was too light, then I tried 417 which was too dark.

Printer quality is fine. It is convenient to be able to print from your phone or other devices wirelessly.

Now for the opportunities: Printer is on, but rarely showing as available in the HP Smart app. This requires a restart of the printer. Every time you restart the printer, it prints an alignment page. EVERY TIME. At this point Im convinced its intentional to get you to buy ink more frequently.

Ive had this printer for a year and regularly look for a setting to get it to stop printing alignment pages and none exists.

The backgrounds are beautiful, the music is great, and the story certainly keeps you interested rather than begging for the skip button.

However, the game frequently glitches in graphics-intense scenes with significant stuttering visuals, phantom enemy attacks, and missed commands.  A good example is the legendary enemies Spawn of Oggdo and Rancor.  Often times you dodge an attack correctly, see that you're out of danger, only to have the enemy glitch-turn and have their fatal attack land despite you being out of the way or another enemy blocking their path. 
 There is a glitch in which you get stuck in the back of the Mantis and can only resolve this glitch by completely closing the program and powering off the PS5 then restarting.  Lastly, the difficulty is INSANE on some of the bosses/legendary enemies/force tears.  My first run-through was only on ""Master"" difficulty and it took dozens if not over 100 attempts each to defeat the Spawn of Oggdo, the Rancor, and the Double Rancor.",4,0,0.194967532,0.578625541,180.0,4.8,0.4839256198347108,1,431

I read all the reviews and still decided to take the cheaper route and buy this HP printer. 
We were able to get it connected to WIFI although it wasnt as smooth as I was hoping it to be with the app they have you download. The biggest problem is that it constantly cancels the print job in the middle of printing. Then the page just sits there stuck in the printer. None of the buttons would do anything afterwards. The power light will just flash. Also we had to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in to reset it so it would accept each new print job. The printer would say it was printing yet it was doing nothing. You spend most of your time trying to troubleshoot why it wont print or why it stopped printing. It took 1 hour to get it to print two pages one night. It was returned back to the store the next day.

Revlon's Illuminance foundation is great for aging skin like mine. I know I should be using a full coverage formula to cover wrinkles and marks but my skin doesn't take to thick products and I really feel I need something that lets my skin breathe sometimes. I like that the coverage is light. Yes, it doesn't cover every blemish but it makes my skin look soft and fresh. I don't think it was very illuminating unless you count that it didn't make my skin look dry and matte which I don't like. I want a dewy look. I got a somewhat dewy look...if that counts as illuminating. I feel like my face breathes. ONLY THING: I got the wrong color. Technically this is my color match but I always go somewhat darker because of my rosacea and because I like a sun kissed look. This was far too light. I try to make it work. I use it for my lighter days and just go a little heavier on the bronzing.

Windows, Office Suite nowadays are acceptable to use compared with those early days. I, however, initially resist the whole concept of paying annual fees for Microsoft 365.

But I finally turned around when I realize I can drop by Dropbox account and use the One Drive for what I need. The Microsoft Money is still useless but the Stock price (15 minute delay) and stock price history (only available for beta channel) alone saved me a lot of troubles too.

The crisp, bright picture is remarkable and its bright regardless of room atmospherics - literally I dont think any other brands have something comparable to this screen technology. The viewing angle does not make a difference in picture clarity. The sound from the internal speakers is surprisingly good, voices are clear and has a good amount of base- probably the best internal tv sound Ive ever heard. The only thing that made me rate it four rather than five stars is Ive not been able to stream picture and sound via the HDMI connection as I could on my previous (2018) LG tv. It doesnt matter what type of cable or HDMI connection cable I use, it just doesnt work. A big disappointment considering I like to stream hockey matches through my laptop and I can only use my laptop speakers for playback. The tv recognizes the computer connection, but no settings or adjustments to any settings resolve the lack of sound. Its surprising considering I did this successfully on an earlier non OLED LG television. Otherwise outstanding performance, easy to connect a cable box, a blue ray player and to connect a soundbar via the digital optical cable. I recommend this television and will strongly consider purchasing an LG television again.",4,0,0.2625,0.515277778,241.0,4.7,0.4353975468975468,1,533

539,9054,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,This is a Wii-U Port,Bryan,"This game, while an improvement, is quite literally a Wii-U port. Many will simply shove this off as Mario Kart itself is simply a continued resurrection of the same core gameplay. However, this game is notably a copy/paste of Mario Kart 8 on the Wii-U that they didn't even bother to change the name enough. They actually fixed the battle mode, fixed the item system during matches, and offered all DLC in lump-sum purchase. The game itself is a better rendition this time with HD quality within the game but a lot of things are still amiss. For example, the coin item is still in the game, item distribution by default in online is still wacky, kart mechanics are not traditional, etc. Overall, this game is what you'd expect from a true Mario Kart game but we shouldn't have had to buy a Switch just to get it, PERIOD.",4,0,-0.0125,0.421964286,149.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,1,540

I was glad it was neutral a beautiful contrast. I will say this neutral  has a gray taupe look to me but changes with light, but very beautiful.

However, the stylus is garbage. It can never connect and always has issues when using it. My previous model never had issues with connecting to it. It still works when it can't connect, but not having a feature that doesn't work properly for how much the product costs, is ridiculous. Also, God forbid you drop your phone, the stylus pops out and you have to find it which can be troublesome if you are outside. Also, the dead zones! I live in a rural area. Whe. 5g isn't available, my phone is useless. 4g takes over and I can't even get amazon music to work. I have to make sure that I load my Playlist before leaving my home and wifi connection or I have to wait 5 to 8 miles away from my home. Even in cities, the drop offs of service sucks. The features of streaming music does make it seamless for vehicle connection for Bluetooth. Even the option for screen mirroring to my TV. But the phone changing the volume and having to randomly turn it back up on my phone is annoying. Bixby needs improving. If it's going to compete with Google or Alexa, more marketing and integration.

A phone call lead me to someone who could help. I felt that there was no reason for me to have to do so since it cost me more money.

As far as using it goes, I'm learning as I find something new to do with it. I don't like having to go to the web every time I want to learn & there's no ""Help"" on the program - at least none I've found yet. The old program had assistance imbedded in the program OR you could go to the web.

I still show my old Office icons and I'm afraid to remove them since that might remove my Picture Manager. Over the time I've had it, it has been the most dependable picture editor I've used and I can't figure out why Microsoft no longer offers it as part of the package.

Since I've only had it for a short time and, except for Outlook, don't use it on a daily basis, I still have a lot to learn. Hopefully, some of the things I feel are shortcomings in the program now will work themselves out.",4,0,0.081168831,0.469967532,215.0,4.5,0.4601818181818181,1,696

Kind of disappointed. There's seemingly little challengs, and most everything (tracks, characters, courses) is available right off the bat. You don't even have to push the 'gas pedal' anymore! You can literally set the control down and finish the race by letting it drive itself, and you may even finish in a good position. They tried too hard with the tracks to make them 'exciting'...instead some of them are just garish and chaotic and dizzying. MORE MORE MORE doesn't always mean a better game, and that's what happened here. It seems aimed at 5 year olds who always want to be a winner. If nothing else they should have put in more controls over the game parameters to make it even a little more challenging like the old Wii version which was vastly superior. If you want the numb sugar coated version, set it to that. If you want a game with a little challenge, set it to old school rules. If you loved Mario Kart Wii, this game will probably disappoint you and seem way to easy.

I love the compartments. I use them for my baskets each labelled so I can find things. It's a nice looking shelf too. Even though it's cheap particle board, it looks great in the natural light imitation wood and goes with any bedroom furniture.

Instructions were good and useful but since it's not a small piece of furniture, two people are recommended rather than one. It seems sturdy enough even though it's not real solid wood. I think the backboard it a bit too weak though. It would have been better to put no board there at all rather than a thin sheet of cardboard.

798,11003,Target,Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum,499.99,Returned it...,MickMaine,"I bought this upright with high hopes. I have family and friends that have older ones and love them...I didn't. Considering how much these cost, I expected the machine to be of a higher quality. I know most vacuums are largely plastic these days but I thought this one would be a better grade of plastic, it just wasn't. One side panel came loose just from grabbing an edge of a throw rug, the extra tools were REALLY flimsy and I didn't trust them to last a year. The maneuverability was not the easy glide it shows in the videos, very difficult (for me at least) and definitely not something you can get under furniture. The video shows using the extra tools and extension hose for that - good luck! The hose is almost impossible to keep extended while the machine is running, unless you are Hercules. The one positive thing I will say is that the suction to pick up stuff in my carpet was terrific. However, the negatives outweighed that one positive. I went back to a canister vac by someone else.",2,0,0.110843393,0.465085193,184.0,4.2,0.4135238095238094,1,799

832,10975,Target,Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum,499.99,"The good, the bad, and the questionable.",Just Some Guy,"Our last vacuum was a DC-07. Used it for 18 years. It was a great vacuum overall, and would still be going strong today, but my wife needs something easier to handle due to her bad back. She narrowed her choices down to two vacuums: the Ball Animal 3, and a competitor's. Obviously, given our positive experience with the DC-07, we went with the Dyson, and also because the competitor's model still uses bags (seriously?) which we didn't want to deal with. In terms of engineering, the Ball Animal 3 is impressive. The suction is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's so powerful that in some cases--like bathroom rugs, hallway runners, etc--it's actually a detriment because the rug buckles as you're pulling the vacuum back. My wife likes the head design; it's lower to the ground so it can get into tighter spaces under chairs, etc. I also like that you can see the brush bar while operating the vacuum, so you know whether it's spinning or needs to be cleaned. So as far as engineering and technology are concerned, the Ball Animal 3 is fantastic. The vacuum's Achille's heal, however, is its ergonomics. This is not an easy vacuum to use, and requires a fair amount of strength to push around. I'm 6'3"" 250+ lbs, and by the time I'm finished vacuuming with the Ball Animal 3, my shoulder feels like it's going to fall off, and my back hurts for about a half hour afterwards, from the coccyx up to the middle. If *I'm* this stiff, sore, sweating like a pig, and gasping for air after using the vacuum, imagine what it must be like for my poor wife and her bad back! This vacuum does not ""roll"" or ""glide"" across the carpet, and frankly I also feel it's a lot harder to maneuver. On a positive note, though, the clutch mechanism is in a much more user-friendly location now (an electronic switch next to the power button versus having to bend over and manipulate a mechanical knob); but then Dyson goes and cancels it out by putting the suction adjustment slider in an even more inconvenient location than where the DC-07 clutch knob was. My wife likes the wand on this unit better than the DC-07. I disagree, but I do like that the tools can be directly attached to the hose now. That's probably the best improvement Dyson made, ergonomically speaking. Unfortunately, the main chassis/body still ""follows"" you around whenever you stretch the hose, getting in the way and making the job harder. The on-board storage of the tools isn't very good, either, and seems like it was more of an afterthought. The brush bar is much easier to remove on the Ball Animal 3. It's more of a sleeve that fits over the actual rotating mechanism, so no special tool is required to disconnect the drive belt from the roller bar. Lastly, both filters on the Ball Animal 3 are washable (the post-motor filter on the DC-07 wasn't washable and had to be replaced periodically, and was difficult to access). Now as for the construction of the Ball Animal 3, that remains in question. Some of the plastic, particularly in the handle and the flip-up wand end cap, is really flimsy and bends way too much. I feel like it's going to snap or permanently deform at any moment. However, being open-minded, perhaps the flexibiltiy helps _prevent_ the plastic from snapping. I don't know. Time will tell. I'm torn. On the one hand, I want the Ball Animal 3 to give us 18+ years of reliable service like the DC-07 did; but on the other hand, I am not looking forward to my wife and I (especially her) having to lug this thing around while using it. We may be back in the market sooner than later.",3,0,0.080294941,0.41107919,641.0,4.2,0.4135238095238094,1,833

HP has a history of being ink overlords, shutting down competition to keep their prices high. What's wrong here is that the printer comes with ""3 MONTHS OF INSTANT INK INCLUDED WITH HP+  Print up to 700 pages a month and get ink delivered only when you need it. After 3 months, monthly fee applies unless cancelled, and you'll save up to 50% on ink.""

The only ink I got was what came with the printer. I signed up for the instant ink and was billed monthly. They sent paper I ordered, but no ink.

UPDATE: You are not buying a printer, you are buying ink. A few months after I cancelled my enrollment in HP's ink plan, the printer was flashing an error code and would not print. HP support fixed my problem after enrollment in the ink plan. There was nothing wrong with the printer or the ink cartridges. HP was keeping it from working until I renewed my enrollment.

He weighs about 55 lbs. and he is just the right size. I really have a hard time believing that any 12 year old could ride and enjoy this-but you never know.The bike is just like it says-it is pretty sturdy and came as amazon said it would. The one and only drawback is the charge time for the one ride. The thing has to be charged for 8 hours for only 35 minutes of ride time. The ratio is a little off. By the time my son rides it in the morning, he has to charge it so long that the play day is gone. I saw that one guy charges his for only five hours-so I guess we will play around and see how much ride time we can get for a shorter time.Overall-if the ride time was longer this would be a pretty great bike. For the short 35 minutes he rides it, he LOVES it. We have only had it since Christmas, so I don't know about the other issues people say they are having with the tires, brakes and chains-to be honest, this was to see if our son could actually handle a real bike by next year.I don't highly reccommend it because of the short ride time/long charge time issue.

One of the big reasons I ordered this is for pizza. Its awesome for parties and large dinners. After a ~25 minute pre-heat, you can crank out one after another in just 4-5 minutes each. There are pre-sets for different types of crust. I went with the thin setting and did my usual pizza recipeWow, this really makes the same old pizza MUCH better. The crust was much more airy and I love browning of the cheese. And it was amazing how easy it was to get that result on the first use at the pre-set time and temp.

And theres so much more it can do. The great thing about these Woodfire products is that they can impart a ton of smoke flavor with just a handful of pellets. Ive done jerky, pulled pork and a brisket flat. All taste and look like they came out of a Traeger! Look at that bark!!! And so easy too.

I only wish this had a viewing window in the door. Otherwise its the perfect product. Compact enough to be somewhat mobile (although heavy) and great for a small patio or balcony. But still big enough to handle 12 pies, brisket flats, and decent sized birds. Ninja is really changing the game with these.

Pro tip: Ive been using non-Ninja pellets in this and my Woodfire grill with no issues. The off brand pellets really open up the flavor options and saves money too. Just buy quality ones designed for food, NOT FUEL! Bon appetit!",5,0,0.212017694,0.511673882,283.0,4.6,0.486998556998557,1,935

Its amazing what this oven is capable of for its size. It has to be plugged in of course but isnt too bulky to be moved around, and its very easy to use (even for cooking beginners like me). I was most excited to try out the pizza making function, and it did not disappoint! It comes with woodfire pellets that gives pizza an outstanding flavor  I honestly dont know if I want to eat pizza any other way. The pizzas cook to perfection in just under 3 minutes, and the oven has great heat retention after you open and close the door. You will have to buy a pizza peel separately, but its worth it. I also really love that this oven can function as a smoker and a dehydrator.

The graphics have improved significantly over Mario Kart 7. All content is available from the beginning, which is great and terrible at the same time. The potential to unlock characters was a big part of the game for me, and I miss that from this release. You can unlock one character, Gold Mario which replaces Metal Mario but that is it.

There's a wide variety of maps available, most of them are stunning and very fun to play. I'm disappointed with Battle mode, there is only a very small collection of maps available, and some are absolutely broken on certain mini-games like Renegade Round-Up where a match might last 19 seconds, even when playing against easy AI players just because they're so small and there aren't that many places to run around to.

It is easy to navigate and allows both guided assistance or direct entry onto the requisite forms. If you've used the program in the previous year, much of the personal data will be transferred automatically, a great time-saver. Being guided through the income and deduction sections prevents you from missing something that the IRS won't, especially income. Each possible source of income (or deductions) is listed and that will help you find items you might have otherwise missed. The Review section picks up any errors and allows you to make the necessary corrections and estimates your Audit risk. Filing electronically is generally easy (last year there was a problem with verifying my on-line ""signature"" (based on preceding year's data, passcode, etc.) This year was a snap and both state (extra $20) and Federal refunds were quickly obtained. (Remember: if you file early it makes it less likely that your identity and refund will be stolen. Apparently the IRS will send your stolen refund to someone else placing the onus on you to somehow correct the problem - good luck with that!)",4,0,0.114130435,0.521014493,204.0,3.4,0.6367559523809524,1,997
997,797,Target,Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G Unlocked (128GB) Smartphone - Burgundy,1199.99,This phone can do it All!,itsTanya,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been a samsung fan since like the note 2 and every time a new phone comes out I run out to upgrade. This S22 Ultra did not disappoint as it was in my opinion a much better version of the note series. Does everything the note 20 ultra did, with more style and a few extra features. The s pen doesn't get enough attention in my opinion but I use it for soooo many things. Simple screenshots and highlighting parts of screenshot before I send to a friend, or Simple note taking, or making lives and gif photos! Endless possibilities. Also, I tried the iPhone 13 pro max when it came out also, I could not believe how people could even put it on the same scale as samsung. Samsung allows you to do multiple things at the same time with such speed and so easy and user friendly. I can minimize any screen or app and put It in a small corner if I want, to watch news or something, while simultaneously online shopping and texting all from the same screen. Can't do that with apple. Just saying! Get the Samsung! Oh!!! And there literally is no better camera. Takes jpg and raw photos if you want to edit and be like a professional photographer with it lol. I am not but my stuff comes out great with the basic settings. I do like having the options to enhance photos though. Great phone. Will eventually upgrade to the s 23 ultra once the trade in value is a tad bit better for me. Tough times mean we can't run out and spend an extra 400 on a phone upgrade unless it's absolutely necessary....sigh*",5,0,0.129584628,0.437817877,295.0,4.6,0.4695056042149065,1,998

Medlin,"We bought two of these motorcycles for our 7 and 8 year old grandsons. They absolutely love them. It took the younger one a few spills before getting the hang of it, but once he did he is riding it very well. I would suggest starting out on grass and practicing before hitting the sidewalks and road. They do run well on all surfaces. I would also suggest purchasing good kids helmets and gloves as the motorcycle can reach almost 15 miles per hour. So far the motorcycles seem to be constructed very well. We charged the batteries a full 24 hours before initial use and the charge has lasted extremely well. The other great plus is that they are battery powered not gas so they will be easy to transport and can be ridden in most residential areas where kids gas powered vehicles are restricted. The only downside I see so far is that the batteries are not easy to access therefore making it a bit difficult to buy backups and quick change and they only come in one color making it a bit difficult for the grandsons to tell which one is theirs.

1028,8930,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,List of Changes (Compared to the Wii U version),Vincent,"This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:

1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original

2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl)

3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item

4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth

5. ""Smart Steering"" A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.

6. ""Auto-accelerate"" for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral

7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup

8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against

9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on

10. Online Play.
-Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the ""Y"" button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.

- You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early

-When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match

- More icon packs for tournament mode

11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen

12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo

13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game

14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages

15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc)

16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match

17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:

-Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.

-Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell

-Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs

-Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out

-Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it

==Additional notes:
- There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps

-There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players

-Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse

-No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down

-No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo

-Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced

-Other balance changes:
Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.

Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on

If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked.

Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shell

Easier to break while drifting (advanced tactic)

-Luigi still has his signature death stare

If there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.

Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",5,0,0.102763017,0.417699571,1164.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,1,1029

I've been shopping/researching for a TV for quite some time as my previous ULED was having issues. I had seen many OLED TVs from different department stores and they immediately always caught my eye. So I was beyond thrilled at my opportunity to purchase my very own LG OLED. The box the TV comes in makes it easy for almost anyone to unbox this TV. I've seen how thin this TV in person was so I was a little nervous about how it would fare in transit. However, after receiving the TV and unboxing it I noticed plenty of padding to keep the TV safe and sturdy. The setup for this tv was very quick and easy and the tv is very light compared to others. Once the TV was plugged in, the setup process was very fast and I was watching this TV in no time. This TV will take your breath away as soon as the picture turns on. You will be met with tremendous colors and deep blacks that provide for an almost 3D-like appearance. This TV even makes standard-definition programs look substantially better. I've enjoyed trying out many different types of media such as PS5, 4k streaming and 4k Blu-ray discs. All of which have blown me away! This TV is an experience that must be tried and you will not be disappointed! This TV is also accompanied by Magic Remote. I was somewhat familiar with this remote as I had one with an older LG LED TV and the new one was leaps and bounds better than what I remember. I really can't say enough about this TV and there is no looking back from here on out, it's LG OLED or bust for me!",5,0,0.211499319,0.562329545,319.0,4.7,0.4353975468975468,1,1061

The boxing came ripped yet put together by tape and you could see Styrofoam pieces coming through the cracks. I know that boxes can get damaged due to traveling in the trucks, so I assumed thats the reason the box looked that way. The box even had a sticker that was marked heavy but it did not feel heavy at all. I go to open it to start putting it together and the Styrofoam gets all over the place... Its all over each piece, all over my living room, and all over my clothes. I start taking out pieces and I knew right away that a lot of the shelving pieces were missing, and they were.
Im surprised that this item has such good reviews, because it does look nice, but I feel like it is still cheap quality. I did not see anyone else note that the legs that support the complete shelving unit are made of plastic. I think whatever you place on these shelves need to be very lightweight like picture frames and maybe a vase or two Small weightless items. I was planning to put Toys, books, puzzles for my daughter and I dont feel that this shelving unit would support the weight of those items.
I obviously had to return it, but if I give any kind of suggestion to anyone thinking of buying this shelf, it is to think about what it is youre going to be putting on the shelves to make sure that they are lightweight enough and to take into consideration the legs are plastic- you could probably not attach them if youd like.. but thats one of the high quality-looking features. If I wanted a simple, cheap shelf, I would just buy one at target for half the price.",2,0,0.083501984,0.558892196,304.0,4.5,0.5344227994227995,1,1076

1160,9004,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,Great classic game back and better than ever with modern updates!,C. Taylor,"Pre-ordered from Amazon for the Switch, and it's our favorite game, so far. Not going to lie, MARIO nostalgia runs big in this family, and even the next generation is already a big MARIO fan. All the great aspects of the classic MARIO Kart games have been preserved. The battles, the races, the ability to edge out your opponents with banana peels, turtle shells or a good old fashioned side swipe. There are tons of classic Nintendo characters to chose from, as well as courses from other Nintendo franchises. Let's just say Link for Zelda is a favorite for one of the kids. As parents, we enjoy battling each other in some good, healthy competition. Oh, I should mention the graphics look great on our tv, too!

My only complaint is more to do with the game system than the game. Initially we played the game with a pro controller and the joy con L/R controllers locked into its base to make it work like a pro. The left joy con kept shorting out like it was having an interference problem. We had to ditch the pro controller and each use one of the tiny Joy Cons (I used the left and husband used the right). It fixed the issue, but they are so tiny they aren't as fun to hold like that. However, I have noticed the L joy com joy stick act a little funny with other games, so I'm not docking a star as it may be more of a Switch issue. I have read about other Switch owners having a similar problem. My advice - if you can afford the pro controllers at the hefty $69.99 a piece price tag, buy two of those to play this game.",5,0,0.178396359,0.413445378,291.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,1,1161

1196,8920,bestbuy,Igloo - IMX 24 Quart Cooler - Gray,94.99,Almost perfect outdoor oven,Dylnel,"Upon receiving this oven, I was excited to make my first pizza. First thing I noticed was the size. It is not too big and not too small for my yard which is great. The build quality is excellent and everything feels solid. Front door needs a little muscle to open. It is pretty tight which I wasnt expecting. No issue with that though.

Once setup, I started the oven up to cook at 700 degrees. Took about 25 minutes to reach this temp which was perfect as it gave me time to prep my pizza. 
Right before I put the pizza in the oven, I added the included pellets which give off a nice smoke but at 700 degree it would be a quick cook so its really not enough time for the smoke to sink in.

I followed the directions for a Neapolitan which said 700 degrees for three minutes. Checked on it after 3 minutes and it was definitely cooked, maybe a little overcooked. What would be very helpful is putting glass on the door or somewhere to view the pizza as it cooks to avoid having to open and close the door as it cooks.  This is my only issue with this oven.

Dont get me wrong, I am sure with some practice I can figure out the right amount of time to cook the pizza at such a high heat. At the same time, I feel like no two pizzas are the same so it may not be that easy. Time will tell.

Overall, it is a great well made product but I have to take a star away due to the fact that there is no way to view what is being cooked.",4,0,0.208662465,0.557677404,286.0,4.6,0.6221153846153845,1,1197

We immediately fell in love with LG OLED C3 line. After buying it and having it for a few weeks now, I have to say it has lived up to everything we wanted. The picture quality is fantastic. It's thin and sleek, and fit our Man-Cave perfectly. The biggest thing for me was finding something that could fit both my need for gaming and sports. Being able to switch between Rocket League and NHL games, or go from the NBA to Call of Duty has been beyond ideal. Another feature that's been huge is the cast to TV. The LG app works really really well with the TV, especially in casting my video work up on the big screen.

Now let's get to the but....
Accessories that would be fine as friction fittings actually require alignment and mechanical fittings. They also require mechanical disconnection.
To use those accessories the body must be disassembled.
The extension hose to mount the accessories is much happier in its resting state and fights when extended. Not great for grooming.
For something sold as a pet groomer, it it wrongly engineered and inconvenient. I'll be keeping it because it still does well on rugs and floors. I can think of much better ways to groom pets.

The door of the new model is so much lighter, I already see the need to be more delicate with handling, especially when closing it. The two latches that lock the door are made of plastic and seem flimsy. If not careful to align the door properly, the top latch pulls closed before the bottom, which seems to put more pressure on the plastic piece as the bottom of the door bends slightly outward.

The sheer brightness of the Samsung logo upon powering on was new to me. This phone has triple the brightness of my previous phone, and let me tell you, it shows. I love being able to use this phone outside and not having to deal with sun glare on thr beach. Additionally, the Snapdragon Gen 1 chip in this phone is more than powerful enough for any task: gaming, mild video editing; this thing is a tank. It once got me out of a crunch at work where I had no access to a desktop to video edit. I was able to use Samsung's DEX to use my phone as a desktop on an external display. It was very user friendly and did not impact battery life. That brings me to my next point... the battery on this phone is amazing. Not only has it held consistent charges through different charging methods (ie. Wireless, Super-Fast Charging, Normal, etc.), but the reverse wireless charging that I can use with my Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and any other devices that need to be charged has helped me out tremendously. Finally, the camera is amazing. Truly, amazing. I have been asked countless times to share my photos with others, and using Samsung QuickShare, I can do that without compromising quality. I have used video and photos shot on the S22 Ultra for professional production, and taking 8k video makes video editing a breeze. Showing off this camera is my favorite thing to do, especially with S-Pen and Watch controls. Great job Samsung! S23 incoming!",5,0,0.220233586,0.566201073,282.0,4.6,0.4695056042149065,0,1457

After watching many review videos and reading we decided that going with something else when our old Dyson lasted 16 years was just not gonna happen. The only negative comments about this I could find was the somewhat difficulty level of pushing. In all honestly if you dont have some resistance when operating then its probably not cleaning like it should be. This vacuum is not too difficult to push or pull and if it is you might need to address some other issues other than your vacuum. As far as the performance of this machine it by far exceeded my expectations. I didnt realize how much stuff our old unit wasnt picking up until using this. (See pic for reference on how much just our living room a AFTER I USED OUR OLD ONE ) overall Id highly recommend to anyone. Awesome buy.,5,0,0.186304348,0.499565217,158.0,4.4,0.450384024577573,0,1541

The price was $220, which is a great price for any motorized ride neverless a motor bike. I was reading other reviews and I saw people saying their kids saved their money and were disapointed because it had no suspension etc or the battery life is not good. Well if you are buying a motorcycle for $200 and think it is going to be the same as a Honda or Yamaha then you were greatly mistaken, those bikes start at $700 used. My son learned to ride a motorcycle by riding this bike in our yard and even took it on a couple trails. He now has one of those expensive bikes but only because he learned the basics on the Razor. I still have it and when his buddies come over they learn to ride on this bike as well. If you charge the battery for the correct amount of time before using it you will not have any trouble. We have the bike for 3 years and it still works great. And I would recomend it to every one, I am 185lbs and I even ride it around yard (not for serious dirt bike riding).

I like that this is more compact and much lighter than my previous printer. It takes up less room, and when it decides to work, it prints quickly and well. It was also reasonably easy to set up for the first time.

I dislike that it stalls out printing and takes nearly 3 hours (with stops and starts and refreshing the job and canceling and reprinting) to actually print my documents and you have about 30 pages in black and white of printing before the ink runs out completely. I should have looked before I bought to note that it cannot print doublesided, and the gravity feed for the paper gets jammed easily and can only hold about 25 pages at a time. I used it for the first time today and could not complete my printing jobs because I have no more ink (it was literally making printing sounds and the pages were coming out completely blank.

I didn't keep the box because I foolishly thought this printer would be a viable option, or else I'd return it.",2,0,0.104761905,0.40952381,187.0,4.1,0.594556277,0,1771

I was a little intimidated and apprehensive to use the Ninja Woodfire Outdoor Grill when I first got it but, I am learning how to use all of it's functions and actually enjoying our new level of cooking. This outdoor oven is very versatile. Smoker, broiler, baker, dehydrator and roaster all in one appliance makes it the favorite outdoor appliance. The front control panel is easy to see and use. You only need to change the cooking function, temperature, time and if you want the woodfire flavor smoke added to your cooking choice. The pizza setting has extra custom settings to use, which includes what type of pizza you are cooking (frozen, thin crust, etc.) and will preheat the pizza stone for you so the crust comes out perfect each time! I love how easy the instruction book is to read and follow. It includes basic recipes for beginners to help ease into the outdoor oven. The package also included a pack of woodfire pellets. The all-purpose blend flavor gave our roast a mild woodfire flavor and turned our mac n cheese flavor into the most flavorful mac n cheese we have ever had! The smoker feature is the best feature in my opinion! The oven is easy to clean and several parts are dishwasher safe. I am purchasing the adjustable table, attachable side table and oven cover to make it easier to keep outside and clean from the outdoor elements.",5,0,0.3039361,0.548386034,263.0,4.7,0.4839813311688312,0,1992

It satisfied all of my requirements for size, inside space, and cooking power, it has the ease-of-use options I wanted (eg., quick start cooking for 1-6 minutes, ""add 30 seconds""). Most importantly for me, it has a humidity sensor that allows me to easily cook potatoes (my go-to food item) and other foods with the push of one button. Most other low-cost microwaves require you to enter the ""number of potatoes"" after pressing the potato button, and an often-inaccurate cooking time is then calculated by the microwave (since it doesn't know whether you're cooking mammoth or tiny potatoes). This microwave just senses the humidity to determine when the potatoes (or popcorn or leftovers) are ready. That's my kind of cooking!",5,0,0.355128205,0.629487179,124.0,4.4,0.3945085778419112,0,2143

For some reason, when I opened up the program to continue my tax return, there were now TWO returns showing, both IDENTICALLY named. I had to carefully examine the contents of each to determine which one to delete (the illegitimate one). I had to delete the file through a windows interface, as I couldn't see any way to delete it using TT's menu. After doing this, THREE files showed up. I gave up on this. I never e-file my state return, as they charge for it, and I refuse to pay for something that makes their job easier. TurboTax never gave me the option to print out my state return with only the required forms; instead, I could only print out the return using the records printing interface. Because of this, I'm sure I'm including worksheet(s) that aren't required for the ""return only."" And then, the state return printed out had pages related to e-filing, as if I'd e-filed this return. The cost of a state module should include all of the state forms that may be required, not just a few of the major ones. To have to obtain a separate form for calculating energy saving improvements like solar in this day and age is ridiculous. TurboTax should have them already, not something I have to print out, fill out by hand, and attach to my return. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this, or the product just isn't becoming easier to use and more comprehensive as most products would strive to be. Overall, a very disappointing experience this year.",3,0,0.117598039,0.667581699,280.0,4.3,0.6581573498964806,0,2159

However, their engineers stopped all innovation after that. The rest of this device is literally like stepping back in time to 1985. Nothing is foot-operable, you have to jerk the handle downward to get it to engage and click into place, the parts are cheap and easily snapped. Worst of all for me was zero cord management. If you have ever owned any of the many vacuums that are half this price and include a retractable cord, you will hate operating this thing. You're literally lugging a cord around and bending down 8-10 times all the way to the ground when raveling or unraveling the cord. Exactly like we did in the 80s. This is an example of a company making twice the normal market cost on a product because of one and only one overblown reason.

While it had the problem of the computer getting super human speed every time it was behind, it didn't detract from the races too much.

Fast forward to 8 on the switch and the tracks remind me of F-Zero, which i think is pretty cool. I like the driving dynamics and how you have to use your brakes on 200cc to avoid hitting the walls, however, the use of items by the cpu characters gets really annoying. The blue shells, lightning, and ink blots occur almost in every lap. This becomes a nuisance after a while as the game seems to rely heavily on the use of items. In the N64 version, you were lucky if you got one of these gamechanger items per race. Also, getting a coin as an item is kinda lame.

Conclusion: it's definitly fun but the item use may get annoying",3,0,-0.064912281,0.477192982,155.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,0,2338

I got the color ""Hustle"". It honestly looks nothing like Elf's official photos. It's actually a darker terra cotta/clay pot type of color. Super orange! I have really pale skin, so this color looked awful on me, but I think it could look great on someone with warm toned tan skin.

The lipstick is heavily pigmented, not sheer in the slightest. It's mostly matte, but it does have a creamy sort of look to it. It doesn't feel like it will be drying, but I don't like the color so I haven't worn it for an extended period of time.

It does transfer to anything that touches your lips. Cups, glasses, food, tissues, etc. However, it doesn't rub the lipstick off... my lips still look the same even though it transferred to my cup. I added some photos for reference!",4,0,0.096666667,0.521686391,147.0,4.4,0.4776455026455026,0,2369

Ive have noticed that with mine, if I want the ignition of the wood pellets for smoke I have to used the ignition sequence twice. It is something I noticed and its an easy work around. It cooks faster than most things call for so youll want to keep an eye on the internal temperature starting earlier in the process.

And Samsung has always come out top of class for such devices. I currently have the S22 ultra, and it's been all I need. It's my laptop, desktop, tablet, and portable entertainment device that I carry everywhere in my pocket when I'm not pressing my nose to the screen. I keep my business organized with the many built in Samsung apps, as well as my social media accounts all kept together so I don't miss anything. I honestly don't know if I could run my business as smoothly as I do today because of this all in one device. I make full use of the S pen. It's my little magic wand that keeps my productivity up, and time loss down. Which gives me more time for gaming lol. Off the clock of course. Since having this, I rarely use my TV at home. I gave it 4 stars only because the battery is awful. For such a powerhouse of a machine, it needs the juice to keep it going. Mine is about shot after 6 months. I know the technology is out there. And I have been careful about battery usage, for as much as my lifestyle will allow. So to Samsung i say: you hit it out of the park with this one. But please improve your battery. Many people like me don't have time to be stuck to a wall or car charger. Thanks Guys!",4,0,0.190013228,0.581216931,256.0,4.6,0.4695056042149065,0,2728

2959,9015,amazon,Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - US Version,39.99,"BEST MARIO KART, IF NOT GAME, EVER!",Dudley,"Sorry for the all caps, I just love this game. I had always wanted Mario Kart 8, but sadly I never owned a Wii U.

There is a very wide variety of tracks, being 48 in total (32 from the original game and 12 from the dlc). All the tracks are creative and have their perks, as with any Mario Kart game.

BATTLE MODE IS BACK! There was a battle mode on Mario Kart 8, but it was famous for being lazy (It used race tracks from the game and only had balloon battles). This is all fixed in Deluxe, with eight dedicated battle courses and five battle modes, all of which are amazing.

There are new/returning characters such as Bowser Jr., King Boo, and INKLINGS! Still no Birdo or Diddy Kong, though.

The graphics are updated to 1080p and 60fps docked, from 720p and an odd 59fps on the Wii U.

There are very few flaws, those being small things such as the coin item being too prominent or Pink Gold Peach being a character.

This is the highest reviewed Mario Kart game to date, with the highest first day attach rate. It broke the first day sales record of Mario Kart Wii. This game is AMAZING!

I didn't even mention double items! They are a game changer!

It is very accessible for new players with options such as smart steering and auto acceleration. The only problem is that they are very easy to toggle on, so be careful.

I would definitely recommend. 10/10!",5,0,0.07547181,0.579799268,246.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,0,2960

This new microwave oven is a replacement for GE Model JES1451DN1BB which quit on me a couple of days ago. The former oven was purchased as a floor model and didn't last as long as I had hoped - about 4-5 years. The first problem was that the turntable would continue to rotate when the oven door was open. This went on for about a year. While it worked, I was very happy with it. It was easy to use and heated food well; it also had sensor cooking. My new oven is very similar, but without sensor cooking. GE has many similar model numbers which, I guess, confused me. I assumed that the new model was simply an update of the old. This isn't too much of a problem as I didn't use the sensor feature often. What I really like is the high power express cook and the ""add 30 seconds"" functions. I'm hoping that they work as well in my new GE as they did in the old one. I think that anyone wanting a simple-to-use microwave that heats foods evenly and has the aforementioned features at a good price will not go wrong with Model JES1460DS3BB (I searched without the ""3"" in the model number).",4,0,0.129551515,0.43074632,218.0,4.4,0.3945085778419112,0,2962

Both were outstanding machines that made cleaning far more satisfyingBut this Dyson Ball Animal 3 with attachments takes cleaning to the next level. Its more light and agile than the previous models,yet the smaller head allows you to get in the nooks and crannies much easier. We find the wand to have much more suctioning power to aid us in vacuuming our stairs and we look forward to using the pet groomer with our two large dogs. We have been trying to find the right combination of treats to persuade them to cooperate.

Not sure what it a was, couldve been the brightness, the clarity, the quality, or the thin bezels. Whatever it was. It caught our attention and we were immediately hooked on the TV. I hung the TV on our wall, and it was the best choice ever. The TV itself is honestly stunning, and the audio quality is impeccable with Dolby Atmos, the 4K OLED screen is amazing and perfect for those movie nights were you just snuggle up and are ready to watch some movies. The OS on the TV is also so good as it is almost instantaneous on the response time. There is no lag. This TV is amazing, and I would for sure recommend it to anybody out there!",5,0,0.412443182,0.629116162,194.0,4.8,0.4303401360544217,0,3248

In fact, this is the first phone that feels more like Note series. It's been a year since I own it and the phone is rock solid with amazing performance. These days people talk about Cameras when it comes to mobile phones. This phone has great cameras. Wherever I go, people want me to take their pictures using my S22 ultra. I really do not have to brag about technicalities of these cameras. I can say, those who own S22 ultra need not worry about purchasing a new phone until it stops working completely, because the so called new phone will not have anything new than S22 ultra. Without a second thought go for it.

Here Are My Thoughts,Max451,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really enjoy my Galaxy S22 Ultra. As a professional photographer the camera is the most important feature I look for in a phone. I upgraded from the S21 Ultra and noticed a significant improvement in the photo's I was getting. Being able to shoot and edit RAW output is definitely a big plus. I plan to upgrade to the Galaxy S23 Ultra mainly for the camera improvements. I also like the battery life and top notch display on the S22U. I can edit many of the photographs I take with the phone and my other cameras right on my Samsung S22U easily, and be confident they'll come out great. I'm very happy with the results I'm getting. A couple small details I would like to see center around ergonomics. It would be easier to use the S-pen if the screen were flat. Also, it would be more comfortable to hold the phone for long periods of time if the square corners were more rounded. But these are minor details. Overall, I've been using Samsung phones for a number of years and have been quite happy with all of them.",5,0,0.315355181,0.530259027,199.0,4.6,0.4695056042149065,0,3315

I have returned both coolers and received refund for original cooler, but that was under warranty. Every single person I talked to at Igloo, assured me they would make this right! As of this date, they have not! I had to spend money with their carrier as they would not ship it back without repackaging the damaged product, which their shipper had damaged! I do not ask for the $100 in gas and time for two days travel because they sent damaged product twice, but did expect them refund the repackaged gift fee that they were making right but they have not and are ignoring any contact!

Igloo coolers, by far, has the worst customer service on the planet. The products I received were either inferior or damaged. Dont seem to care that returning each time is a day trip for me, a ton of gas and time as I am a homesteader living very outlying. These coolers are my refrigerator system for now so I have to be able to rely on them. Have also explained this and just say return again. And their solution is well give you 20% off your NEXT one!

Easy assembly. Some of the cushions were wrinkled from shipping, but a steamer solved the problem (got this idea from other reviews). However, the couch is shipped in two boxes. Heres where it gets fun

I received two different colors. Collectively, it makes a full couch. However I paid extra for the tan color. One box contained tan pieces, which we ordered, the other contained gray. I (gullibly) didnt realize until after unpacking both boxes that the pieces were different colors. Living in NYC, I dragged this up five flights of stairs myself. After unpacking, theres no realistic way to fit the pieces back into the box it came in.

Its just pretty frustrating that I payed extra for a particular color, and even worse for the mix up of the boxes. The thought of having to find another box of appropriate size and printing a shipping label to return the pieces, amongst dragging it down five flights of stairs again, only to be left with half a couch (for who knows how long) is extremely unsettling.",2,0,0.022777778,0.495555556,180.0,4.0,0.4985294117647059,0,3862

4045,10996,Target,Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum,499.99,Great Suction,Dladd,Love this vacuum. It does a fantastic job getting the hair up from my golden retriever and 3 cats. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hose for stretching the vacuum up the stairs does not come close to the full length advertised. At the full length stretched I cant get to the last 2-3 steps and at that point the vacuum falls over and starts getting pulled up the stairs. FYI I also find that the upholstery attachment gets the animal hair out of the stair runner rug and carpet better than the stair tool. By the way the upholstery tool is unbelievably amazing. It makes quick work out of getting cat hair off chairs and couches. Truly awesome! This vacuum is so amazing that the less than stellar stair hose does not keep me from loving it. I am truly in love with this vacuum. I am very happy with this purchase. I do hope Dyson will lengthen the stair hose though.

The color variation, as shown on the attached photo, may indicate a manufacturing defect. The start-up screen is too cluttered for me, and the settings are not user-friendly or convenient as in other LG OLED TVs Ive used in the past. Moreover, unlike many other TVs from LG and different manufacturers, the Remote Control for this particular TV doesnt have a pause button, which is inconvenient. For all of these reasons, I think this product is OVERPRICED and may need to go back to the drawing board.

It picks up dog hair and dirt/dust so easily compared to our Dyson ball original vacuum. One of my favorite features is that the new vacuum head doesnt allow for my long hair to become wrapped around. I used to spend so much time trying to cut the hair away! The pet grooming tool is pretty cool and does work with our long haired dog. Shes terrified of the sound of the vacuum, though, so that makes using it a bit difficult. My favorite tool is the pet upholstery tool! It cleaned up the hair from our dog beds really well and worked like a dream on the carpeted stairs. The only thing I find difficult with this vacuum is using it on our VERY high pile carpet, even after adjusting the height on the vacuum head. I assume thats just because the suction is just too good so while it makes the vacuum difficult to maneuver, it still does an amazing job! Overall, this vacuum is just amazing and we will get so much use out of it for years to come!",5,0,0.156740225,0.48999609,197.0,4.2,0.4135238095238094,0,4428

It heats food and drink fast, and is well made: good design, made of quality parts, and assembled properly with certain quality assurance methods in place. It is a sturdy unit that doesnt seem the least bit chintzy or cheap  this microwave was not made with the bottom dollar in mind. It has sensors to ensure proper cooking and cook times, a convenient timer, and a clock. I especially appreciate the express cook one-button time cook 1-6 for 1 to 6 minutes of cooking, and the button to add 30-seconds to the cook time is extremely handy, too. I use it frequently, more so than I ever wouldve expected to, and I really enjoy and appreciate the convenience it brings by its thoughtful design by people who are obviously forward-thinking and have the consumer in mind. I would recommend this microwave to anyone who thinks product longevity is more important than just getting the job done as cheaply as possible and prefers lasting products to those that are made to be thrown out and replaced when the cheap components quickly fail. The same folks who would rather pay a little more for good quality and utility of an appliance that will last nearly a lifetime, as opposed to the least expensive option that still looks modern and in-style, but the enamel chips after a month of use and causes arcing for most of its service life *cough*cough*Im looking at you, Emerson!

This smartphone is the perfect combination of power, performance, and style. It is definitely one of the best devices I have ever owned. First and foremost, the S22 Ultra's display is simply stunning. The 6.8-inch screen is incredibly sharp and vivid, with a resolution of 3200 x 1440 pixels. The colors are bright and true to life, and everything just looks amazing on this screen. Whether I am browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the S22 Ultra's display never fails to impress. In terms of performance, this phone is an absolute beast. It is powered by the Exynos 2200 chipset, which is one of the most powerful processors on the market. It handles everything I throw at it with ease, from demanding games to multitasking between multiple apps. I never have to worry about lag or slowdowns with this phone. Another standout feature of the S22 Ultra is its camera system. The device boasts an impressive quad-camera setup, with a 108-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a 10-megapixel telephoto sensor, and a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor. The camera produces stunning photos and videos, with crisp details and vibrant colors. I particularly love the zoom capabilities of the camera, which allow me to capture amazing shots from far away. The battery life of the S22 Ultra is also impressive. The phone features a large 5,000mAh battery that easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use.

Well guys it's like this, ""Who do you seek out when you are stuck on a problem?"" The reason is my phone runs on commen sense meaning you really never get stuck on any one screen as the phones layout forces you to move along thru options right on the screen, and a whole lot like a computer. I also enjoy the Chrome browser as they are pro-active when it comes to security issues. A huge reason is the Ultra fits my hand, as that is a factor that is important as you get older. Mom said you are wrong in not putting a screen protector on your phone. I get a new phone every year as you know, but use science to understand how they produce this glass, and how many times have you noticed one scratch on my phones?

This was a 2022 amended return. The reason that I had to file an amended return was because I had manually entered a 1099-R and then decided to have the application automatically enter the values which worked very well. The only problem was that I did not notice that the original manual entry was still in the system so had a double entry in my return for this 1099-R. I didn't notice it until I entered this year's taxes and looked at the comparison from the previous year and saw the large difference. It would be nice if the application could trigger a warning that there were two identical entries.",5,0,0.335846561,0.599470899,120.0,4.3,0.6581573498964806,0,5404

The colors just pop more on an OLED display which make games look way better. The game mode has the main features like VRR, G-SYNC, AMD Freesync and many more which is great. Just have to keep in mind to not leave the screen idle since burn in can happen, so ive been more mindful to not leave it on.

5506,912,Target,Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G Unlocked (128GB) Smartphone - Burgundy,1199.99,Customer for life,Walrus77,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One the best decisions I have made in quite a long time was purchasing the Samsung s22 Ultra. I had been using other phones and never actually going and buying the top of the line until now. This phone has made my life so much easier by being able to use this for work and in my personal life. I love the fact that it has so many features and things that can help me in doing my job but then on the other hand being absolutely amazing for playing games, or watching any of my favorite anime shows. This is definitely one of those purchases that you can't understand how you've gone your whole life without having. I love the phone so much that I went out and purchased a new Galaxy S8 tablet this one purchase has converted me to being a Samsung customer for life. I don't see how I can go and start using any other phone ever again especially after the amazing pictures the clarity and everything that it has to offer. Honestly I am working on converting my son over as well, because I already got my wife to convert. She stopped using a competitors brand phone that she had been loyal to for the last decade. Thank you for making a product that made me want to fill this out. Normally no matter how much I like a product I typically would never fill out these types of surveys or other things like that, that goes to show that you've made a Believer out of me!",5,0,0.223099297,0.504626623,272.0,4.6,0.4695056042149065,0,5507

It fits perfectly in my hand and pocket. I use it to text, make calls, and send pictures. I check my home security cameras, control my smart home devices, and check on my house when I'm away. I watch programs from my cable system, YouTube, Samsung TV, and other video streaming services on the web. Especially like I can use it as a TV when I shower and connect it to my Bluetooth speakers for sound. I share my web content, photos, and video on each of my 5-Samsung Smart TVs. I play my Spotify and Amazon music services to listen to my favorite music. Combined with my Samsung ear buds, makes the music super. It comes in handy as a flashlight in many dark circumstances. Makes a wonderful timer for my tasks and a great alarm to wake me up. Handy as a magnifying glass when need more than the eye glasses on my nose. Love using the speaker phone for private and/or group conversations. Comes in handy when I need the afore mentioned uses by the pool. Use it to check weather and lightning conditions; especially when out swimming for safety. I have so many situations I use my phone that it's hard to name them all.

PROS: Another well designed and built product, great computerized presets for different style pizzas, nice stone, great heavy duty roasting pan, fast cooking once pre-heated, great thin crust pizzas in 5 minutes, nice smoking functions and infused flavors, built in GFI Breaker on the cord if your exterior plugs aren't up to code, great instructional videos available on line, comes with QuickStart guide, manual and recipes. CONS: It's very heavy, not exactly portable for camping, cord is a bit short (4 feet long total) and you should be about three feet from walls or structures, given the high current draw, an extension cord is not recommended so plan your location accordingly or use the shortest length 12 gauge extension cord if you have to use one. Box came damaged in shipment, but, item was intact and fine. You only get one smoked pizza per dose of wood chips and only 3 doses of chips come with unit (so plan on lots of wood chips, buy in bulk), no utensils come with it, so you'll need high heat pot holders or gloves, and a real big spatula, all accessories are available on line though and lots of flour on a cutting board works to slide it in too!",5,0,0.198209877,0.632592593,209.0,4.6,0.486998556998557,0,5853

Random non-Mario characters being in it, needing to collect coins, and gliding/underwater/zero gravity wall-driving all take away from the fun of racing. I personally also think that items are too big of a factor in winning (although it's not nearly as bad as the Wii Mario Kart was in this aspect).

I'm actually quite disappointed in this game so far, but I'm sure it'll be much more fun once I can play with friends. When it comes down to it, I'm just really desperate for games on my Switch.",3,0,0.029292929,0.506565657,131.0,4.9,0.3885281385281385,0,5860

If you need to print more than a few pages just get something else. I think this printer would only be useful for a student or something that only needs to print 1-2 pages a week.

And why do I call this a scam instead of broken? Because everything else works. But the ink runs out or dies so fast I'm forced to by a new cartridge after nearly every print. I will admit that I use this printer (or have a need to print) only once or twice a month...but its ridiculous that the cartridges become self destructive in that time.

5944,840,Target,Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G Unlocked (128GB) Smartphone - Burgundy,1199.99,Overall a good device as a premium smartphone,timothywli00,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As an Samsung phone user, I upgraded from my old S10 to the new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. I like the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as a premium smartphone. I also like the 5,000mAh battery, which does provide sufficient battery life , a full day for frequent use and 1.5 days for light use . Talking about the camera setup on the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. I didn't notice that much difference despite a quad-camera system featuring a 108-megapixel primary sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto lens, and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens. One thing I like the most of the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G is the S Pen support, which makes it one of the few smartphones that offer stylus compatibility. The S Pen can be used for taking notes, drawing, or navigating the phone. It made my life a lot easier with the quick notes taking feature. However there is one thing I didn't like about the new phone which is the removal of the audio port for microphone on the Samsung S22. I won't be able to use your existing headphones or external microphones that require a traditional 3.5mm audio jack without using an adapter. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G seems to be a nice device for users who want a premium smartphone with long battery life, and advanced features like 5G connectivity and S Pen support. However, it is also an expensive device. I will give it 4 out of 5 as my final verdict.",4,0,0.186639118,0.46518595,267.0,4.6,0.4695056042149065,0,5945

The speed in which it can go back and forth between apps and such is impressive. It also makes multitasking a breeze. You can slide between screens or open multiple up at once. I even use it to mirror onto my Samsung TV when sharing things with the family such as photos or projects I am working on. The camera is very impressive. While it is hard to hold steady when using the 10x zoom feature it still is amazing. I would recommend a tripod for those zoom pictures. I was able to zoom into the moon close enough that once I viewd the picture I could zoom more and actually see the craters on the moon. That's pretty amazing.

6388,8059,bestbuy,"LG - 65"" Class C3 Series OLED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV",1599.99,Done with BestBuy,Christian,"Due to there being a small crack in the frame of the television, we honestly never noticed it due to how small the frame is (the silver border on the television.) and only noticed this now while troubleshooting with LG. LG said that due to that crack our warranty is now voided. I've had conflicting reports with best buy with the store itself saying it will be covered but now while trying to set up the appointment for them to come out and check the television they are saying it's not covered. 

This television is only 2 months old and apart from it being put up on the TV stand it hasn't been moved or handled (except for dusting.) It's barely even been used in general, I'm not sure how to check the hours on it but even for 2 months I'm pretty sure it's under normal use. I'm not sure if the crack was there from the beginning, we didn't really inspect every inch of the television and due to how small the frame is it wasn't even noticable until I got up close to it.                     What imo is most likely a televisin that came with this issue (our fault for not fully inspecting every little inch) or somehow broke under normal usage (it standing on a tv stand) we are now out $2,100 on a 2 month old television.",1,0,0.0325,0.562666667,251.0,4.8,0.4303401360544217,0,6389

I switched with him just because it was easier to use the same brand. Over the period of a year or so, I noticed dark brown stains developing slowly along the seams of my teeth. They wouldn't brush out, but they would polish out with a cleaning at the dental office. I was puzzled because I've never had stains before. I changed my diet, made sure to brush my teeth after coffee - nothing seemed to help - stains always started reappearing around 5 months from my last cleaning. Then I switched back to my favorite toothpaste - this one! I've only been using it about a month, but the stains have virtually disappeared without a professional cleaning.

Incredible design and hardware. I opted for the 256GB model for the additional RAM and I can't say that I have reached a point where I would want more than 12GB of RAM; you can comfortably leave your apps open. The camera photo quality is near the top of the food chain, but video performance still leaves some things to be desired, namely stabilization and more granular video settings. Samsung pushes out timely updates for their flagships which should be a given. I honestly miss the S21 Ultra I used to have though because it had a more manageable, less boxy design, as well as better speakers. I'm not sure how or why the speakers on the S22 Ultra got worse, but do keep that in mind. It is a noticeable difference.

I really dont know where to begin. The holes dont line up, the construction is remarkably shoddy, the parts are uneven and dont fit together properly. The feet dont sit flush against the bottom of the couch, theres a 4mm gap on one half of the center feet, so its only a matter of time until it fails.
Its also super uncomfortable. The smaller cushions are less dense foam than the large cushion, and slightly different thicknesses. The back is also much shorter than it looks, which means sitting in it is awkward.
You also cant return it without paying $75, and its impossible to get back into the box anyway since all the cushions are vacuum sealed and they triple in size once opened.
Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This couch will make you very sad.
UPDATE: its been nine months, and it just gets worse. The center of the couch is collapsing, the cushion foam is deteriorating, and when my girlfriend and I sit on the couch together, we shock each other with static electricity whenever one of us moves.
My roommates are like well, I guess thats what we get for $200. Except it was $420.

The display is really good, and the quality is adjustable. The battery can last most of the day. However, doing intensive things like streaming HD videos on YouTube, which is what I primarily do, can drain the battery quicker than usual. High quality games look great and can drain the battery as well. If I'm not watching videos, gaming, or things like that, the battery can last over a day.
