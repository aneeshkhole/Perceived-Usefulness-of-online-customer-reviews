8K video

Capture more detail with 8K video – the highest recording resolution available on a smartphone. It’s not just another outing with friends, park days in the sun or a weekly livestream. It’s recorded as an ultra-bright and razor-sharp memory – including details that make it amazing

Super-steady Video

Video you capture is effortlessly smooth, thanks to Auto Focus Video Stabilization. Now, your nature shots, dance videos and laughable moments will be clear, steady and unforgettable. 1

Nightography

Some of the best times happen when the sun’s down. Nightography lets you snap or record every single moment clearly — anytime, anywhere, regardless of light. Night Mode has you covered.

Portrait Mode

Skip the glamour shots. With Portrait Mode, your favorite faces (even your pet’s) never looked better. Keep your subject in the spotlight with up to 3x the optical zoom, enhanced image processing and intuitive features. So when the light hits just right, you can start a pro photoshoot on the spot, no matter the distance between you and your subject.

108MP photo resolution

Bring out the detail of every hiking backdrop, sweeping cityscape or group photo with premium detail. Ultraclear 108MP is the highest resolution available on a mobile phone, turning your pics into unforgettable moments.

Bright Display with Vision Booster

Take your must-see content to the next level with a bright display. Whether you’re editing video, staging a shot or simply streaming your favorite show, Galaxy S22 will make it all pop. No matter what’s on screen, every pixel will be silky smooth with an adaptive display that automatically adjusts up to 120Hz — even at max resolution. And it will all be easy on the eyes, thanks to intelligent blue light management.

Adaptive Color Contrast

Streaming on the go, working from your patio or binge-watching late into the night? An adaptive screen on Galaxy S22 automatically optimizes color and brightness, indoors and outdoors. No matter what route your day takes, it’s always a scenic one.

Long lasting battery

Your answer to the dreaded low battery. Galaxy S22 Ultra and Galaxy S22+ intuitively manage your usage to conserve energy on their own so you can go all day and into the next. Share when you want to, stream when you want to and never miss a moment. 2

45W Super-Fast Charging

Life is happening right now, so don’t let a low battery get in your way. With 45W Super-Fast Charging, you’ll quickly get charged up so you can dive back into action. 3

Embedded S Pen

The iconic S Pen is now embedded with Galaxy S22 Ultra. Unleash your creativity and productivity with S Series. Sketch and bring your ideas to life. Edit photos and videos with pinpoint accuracy. And do it all with that pen-to-paper feel.

Premium design and craftsmanship

High design for everyday life — that’s Galaxy S22 Series. With a classy, eye-catching glass-metal-glass design, we’re setting a standard for smartphones. Strut your style in chic, sophisticated colors like Burgundy, Phantom Black, Pink Gold, Green or Phantom White. With our strongest aluminum frame and the latest Gorilla Glass, this smartphone is lightweight and durable to help endure scratches and dings.

Live Sharing With Google Duo (Co-Watching)

“You’ve gotta see this!” Everything’s better together. Share thrills, smiles and all-out belly laughs with friends when you co-watch YouTube from anywhere. Viral video group-watch parties are always better when they’re enjoyed with your faves. 4

Description
The story of Cal Kestis continues in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor™, a third person galaxy-spanning action-adventure game from Respawn Entertainment, developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. This narratively-driven, single player title picks up five years after the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order™ and follows Cal’s increasingly desperate fight as the galaxy descends further into darkness. Pushed to the edges of the galaxy by the Empire, Cal will find himself surrounded by threats new and familiar. As one of the last surviving Jedi Knights, Cal is driven to make a stand during the galaxy’s darkest times - but how far is he willing to go to protect himself, his crew, and the legacy of the Jedi Order?
To survive, players will build upon Cal’s training with an expanded list of iconic Force abilities, combat stances, and lightsaber customizations that can be combined in new and different ways to fight as a Jedi. While the Force is a powerful ally, it may not be enough. Cal will have to get creative and master new abilities, tactics and even leverage the environment around him to overcome the obstacles ahead.
Fans of Star Wars™ will travel to new planets and familiar frontiers as Cal seeks to reunite the crew of the Stinger Mantis. New Force abilities, equipment and upgrades will enable players to search, explore, and re-traverse in new ways across multiple planets, each with their own unique challenges to face. The Galaxy is full of stories, secrets, and treasures to uncover for those willing to face the dangers that lay off the beaten path.
