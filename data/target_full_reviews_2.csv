Everyone I talk to who has an iPhone tells me their favorite feature and so it's a shared learning experience and others are so excited to share!",5,0,

I stuck with this model instead of the pro or pro Max due to the smaller size fits in my hand better. The sound is very good, don’t notice any real difference in picture quality or speed. The one HUGE dislike I have is the side buttons. I bought a normal case, nothing thick like some are, and the buttons are flush with the case. I literally have to use my fingernail and push mightily to adjust the ringer volume or take a print screen. I did not have this problem with my iPhone X.

So plenty of time to get used to it. The things I have gotten used to are knowing that 100% battery life will last me about 2-3 hours of slight use. Knowing that about every few minutes I'm going to have Bluetooth connection issues while listening to music in the car. About once a week it is going to tell me there is moisture in the display port forcing me to use wireless charging despite there being no moisture (poor quality detectors for the charging port). When compared to the phone I switched from (Samsung note 9), the note 9 was better in every category based on battery life, speed, capabilities on running more demanding apps, Bluetooth, and overall quality of the phone. The only thing I can say the S22 ultra does better is its pictures. I believe they sacrificed everything on this phone for a slightly better camera setup than competitors. As someone who doesn't take very much pictures this does me no good. It's hard writing this review given I've been a Samsung fan boy since its wonderful customer service with the note 7, one of my favorite phones despite its rare battery issues, but spending the last year with this phone I can not in good faith recommend this curse to anyone. My only hope is that samsung specifically addresses the battery issues (by far my largest issue with this phone), otherwise I will have no confidence that future phones connection/battery longevity will be any better.",1,0,

It is now Aug 2023 and this phone is complete garbage. For the third time now since owning this phone it has completely lost all forms of service. I cant make phone calls, I cant go on the internet. Nothing. It has said ""Emergency calls only"" for three days now. If I am lucky I can find one small area where I can quickly send a text and hope that it goes through, but thats it. I have done all the resets, gone down the list of issues, messed with the sim card. Nothing helped. I am so done with Samsung. I have 700$ left to pay on this phone and its already garbage.

I would say the screen is tough as nails I've dropped it on gravel face down, from 30ft up on a balcony and into the toilet( don't ask ). I've not got one scratch on the camera lenses through all of that. I do have two problems. The first is a daily reset is necessary due to sluggish performance. The second is that I have serious doubts on the performance of the camera. My work phone is a regular S22 and it's photos are so much better than my S22 ultra.

It is very generous when it comes to features that I am still discovering daily. The size of the screen is just right, and the picture that it shows is unbeatable! I have loved the spen since my first phone in The note series, and they just keep getting better. The one thing I would like with these pens, though, is a tracker of some kind when they fall. A light that blinks, or a soft beeping sound. So small and easy to fall away into a Crack or blanket fold.. I do think the pens are one of the top things I like in this phone. The space is incredible, also. Depending on individual preference, there are 3 data space options available. And not alot wasted on space Samsung or your service provider takes up. I would, however, like to be able to have a sim card space to back up some things. All in all, this phone is amazing and I am so happy that I am able to have one.

This S22 Ultra did not disappoint as it was in my opinion a much better version of the note series. Does everything the note 20 ultra did, with more style and a few extra features. The s pen doesn't get enough attention in my opinion but I use it for soooo many things. Simple screenshots and highlighting parts of screenshot before I send to a friend, or Simple note taking, or making lives and gif photos! Endless possibilities. Also, I tried the iPhone 13 pro max when it came out also, I could not believe how people could even put it on the same scale as samsung. Samsung allows you to do multiple things at the same time with such speed and so easy and user friendly. I can minimize any screen or app and put It in a small corner if I want, to watch news or something, while simultaneously online shopping and texting all from the same screen. Can't do that with apple. Just saying! Get the Samsung! Oh!!! And there literally is no better camera. Takes jpg and raw photos if you want to edit and be like a professional photographer with it lol. I am not but my stuff comes out great with the basic settings. I do like having the options to enhance photos though. Great phone. Will eventually upgrade to the s 23 ultra once the trade in value is a tad bit better for me. Tough times mean we can't run out and spend an extra 400 on a phone upgrade unless it's absolutely necessary....sigh*",5,0,

This series seems to want to change everything I say and sometimes just sits and cycles through all the -Home- main screens while I'm not even touching the phone. When my music is playing, while connected to bluetooth devices (my car, headphones) the music stops if the screen goes blank. Never saw anything like this with any other of my Samsung devices. I have always used Samsung but the size of this device alone is a disgrace. Doesn't fit anywhere. The belt clip holder i purchased to assist with this issue is already broken and that's with extreme gentle use as it is clipped to my car vent and never moves. Clipping the phone in, simply snapped the clip on the back. I have complained about this device and all of its issues since day one. My s9 came to an end of life cycle and after using it for 4 years without a problem seriously increases my hatred fir this 22 ultra",1,0,

Well guys it's like this, ""Who do you seek out when you are stuck on a problem?"" The reason is my phone runs on commen sense meaning you really never get stuck on any one screen as the phones layout forces you to move along thru options right on the screen, and a whole lot like a computer. I also enjoy the Chrome browser as they are pro-active when it comes to security issues. A huge reason is the Ultra fits my hand, as that is a factor that is important as you get older. Mom said you are wrong in not putting a screen protector on your phone. I get a new phone every year as you know, but use science to understand how they produce this glass, and how many times have you noticed one scratch on my phones? That's correct, you have never seen one, and how many times have seen me drop my phone? What's all the laughter I hear, and you tell me five times a day!!

The added benefit of it being a bleeding edge device with technology packed to the brim is icing on top of the proverbial cake. The promise and adherence of security updates arriving in a timely and stable manner is what differentiates Samsung devices from other players in the market. The s pen is extremely useful for note-taking as well as a remote camera shutter. The screen is easy to see outside in daylight and the colors are vivid and realistic. It works well just as a phone too. Calls come through clearly, and I have never had a problem with reception in areas where I have previously had connectivity. Speaking of connectivity it's fantastic that Wi-Fi 6 is packed in and lets me access files on my network at blazing speeds not to mention take advantage of 5G networks to their fullest. Wireless charging is a convenience I didn't know I would appreciate, but it has definitely come in handy. There's definitely something to be said for the absolute Rock Solid reliability of this device. Build quality is top tier - and you really feel like you're getting your money's worth.

Firstly, the phone's design is sleek and elegant, with a large 6.8-inch dynamic AMOLED display that offers crisp and clear visuals. The phone's body is made of Gorilla Glass Victus and aluminum, which gives it a premium feel and ensures durability. The camera system is one of the standout features of the S22 Ultra, with a 108MP main sensor, a 10MP periscope telephoto lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 3D time-of-flight sensor. The camera produces high-quality photos and videos with exceptional detail, even in low-light conditions. The phone's performance is also top-notch, thanks to the Snapdragon 895 processor and 12GB of RAM. The S22 Ultra handles demanding tasks like multitasking, gaming, and video editing with ease, and the 5000mAh battery provides excellent battery life, lasting a full day with heavy usage. The phone's software is also excellent, with the One UI 5.1 providing a clean and intuitive user interface. The phone runs on Android 13, which is optimized for the S22 Ultra's hardware, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

My battery life is awesome, I can go through the whole day without charging my phone and that is using it a lot on social media, calls messages, gaming, etc. Sometimes even 2 days or 1.5 days all depends on weather, signal strength and other few factors. I love the S-pen, I do not know what to do without it. From just taking notes, handwriting, coloring or even marking stuff in my calender. Playing movies with this screen is so great, and the sound with the Dolby Atmos is amazing. I combined my experience with the galaxy buds pro, that other piece of equipment makes a big difference. When I make phone calls the people ask me what phone are you using, your voice sounds great. Another thing that makes this phone amazing is the accuracy of the ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the screen. Sorry for Apple but even my family with 14 pro says my phone is better and faster. The overall performance of this device is A+. Then the outside looks stunning. The quality of materials, design and colors are unique. Samsung has done an awesome job with this phone.

Don't download more than 30 apps, and don't multitask between 6 apps at once, the phone operation becomes buggy, the keyboard actually gets stuck even if you try to close all running background apps. Once it's done lagging behind you have to restart the phone for a fresh start... Also... holding the side button doesn't like hard reset/power off anymore... it's just a Bixby button... so you have to swipe down twice to get to the power button on screen. I'm quite disappointed overall... This was NOT the Droid I was looking for apparently... may need to switch to the dark side, too bad these things don't have test run options before committing.

Prior to its announcement, I was the biggest fan of Samsung note series still believe its the greatest smartphone model to have ever been designed. This is a preface to understanding how distraught and lost I was to learn notes were becoming null&void. Then a ray of light was shown the S pen had made its return all was well in the world again u til 5 to 7 mo ths on. At that point the battery became useless, still is useless was a massive let down to ha e SO MANY stunning g and great features,aspects and qualities of this phone to only get to a point to where I now have them all disabled and toggled off sure I have my s pen,but all adaptive modes and personalisation details are gone I now have e what is the equivalent to a Note 6 in all fields its as if this phone was released that year also with my battery being so terrible. Sad part is I decided to purchase and not lease cause it was the notes return and all I wanted but now here I am 2023 and my phone at full charge last maybe 8 hours if I chose to not use it for anything other than text and calls. I'm not alone on this issue as the majority of owners all have the same complaint. So it had the potential to be that masterpiece just wasn't properly executed. Sadly idk when I can upgrade and that idea is followed by if I should stick with Samsung, and ignorantly allow myself to be duped yet again. Probably will though just wish the battery and charge port was update",3,0,

Light, and easy to hold in one hand without issues - for a guy, I have small hands. The S-Pen is one of my favorites aspects of this phone. The things I can do on the fly - copy the screen and edit is fantastic. I have been very pleased with the camera and find the pictures to be vastly improved over my previous Note phone. I do a lot of landscape photography and find the colors vibrant and very close to what I see with my own eyes. Zooming in works great as long as you only go half the max allowed. This phone serves as my personal and work phone. The company portal effectively separates my personal and work environments. Battery life is excellent. I am using my phone all day for calls, emails, meetings - can get through 1 to 2 days between charges. Also, charges pretty quick. Easy to connect a Samsung Watch and Buds.

The display is truly amazing, so bright that it looks great in direct sunlight but is also able to dim for night use while still keeping great color accuracy. The included S pen is surprisingly useful, and it has a lot of hidden features. Not only can you use it for taking notes and drawing, but it also workes as a remote for taking selphies and much more! I also use the pen between the Galaxy Tab S8 and they both work on each other as well. Another neat aspect is Samsung devices have a similar feature to Airdrop that seamlessly shares files quickly and easily. I use the Galaxy Notes app a lot, and especially for a college student, it's handy being able to write assignments on the tablet and refer back to them on my phone, even edit them! In summary, the S22 ultra is a well rounded phone that is great for photography, gaming, productivity...etc. If there's anything to be improved, it would just be a little more battery life, which the S23U already has!",4,0,

I really appreciate having the S pen always readily available for any purposes. I mainly love the screen captures I can do with it. The phone is extremely fast and responses are instant. But the battery life is a bit shorter than what I'd like. I upgraded from the Note 8 but the S22 ultra seems to either have equal or less battery life than the former. Overall S22 ultra experience has been a pleasure and I highly recommend it since it charges ridiculously fast with the supercharger. My concern with battery life has become insignificant due to fast charge. I love the phone and I hope the upcoming generations have extremely long battery life.",4,0,

Incredible design and hardware. I opted for the 256GB model for the additional RAM and I can't say that I have reached a point where I would want more than 12GB of RAM; you can comfortably leave your apps open. The camera photo quality is near the top of the food chain, but video performance still leaves some things to be desired, namely stabilization and more granular video settings. Samsung pushes out timely updates for their flagships which should be a given. I honestly miss the S21 Ultra I used to have though because it had a more manageable, less boxy design, as well as better speakers. I'm not sure how or why the speakers on the S22 Ultra got worse, but do keep that in mind. It is a noticeable difference. Overall though, a great daily workhorse phone.",4,0,

Overall, I'm pleased with the device as it is fast and does what I need it to do. That said, I have two complaints - the camera and the battery. I have young, active children. They're often running around or doing some sort of activity where I'm promoted to take photos of them. This camera of this phone takes poor action shots. Photos of the kids running, passing a ball, moving in a play are usually blurry. I also have an iPhone 13 XS Max and I know to turn to that device if I want a usable action photo. It's irritating because the Ultra is my primary phone. The battery life is a second chink in the Ultra's armor. At the end of the day, if I haven't topped off my devices, my S22 is usually in the 40-50% battery range while my iPhone is still on the 70-80% range. Yes, the Ultra is my daily driver but even on days when both phones are used minimally, the battery on the iPhone outperforms the Samsung. I get nervous when my battery gets down into the 40s so the difference makes me feel as if the Ultra would be quick to leave me in a bind if I don't watch battery life. Even 20-30 minutes of scrolling news sites in the morning depletes 10-15% of battery. That's far from ideal. The S22 Ultra is a decent device and a good sidekick. I wish its deficiencies weren't as severe because they weaken an otherwise very good device. If I knew what I knew now, I probably would've waited for the S23 Ultra.",4,0,

I've used Samsung phones exclusively since the Note 2, and other than the battery life (I'm a heavy data user), the current lack of headphone jack (and the fact that the phone won't ring audibly when connected to wired earbuds), and my own need for a camera tutorial for maximum photo impact, I LOVE them, and can't see myself using any other series of phones.",4,0,

It has the worst time recognizing my thumbprint no matter how many times I rescan my thumb. In hopes of a better result. And that's really the only negative thing I would say about this superb phone. Plain and simple the S22 Ultra is Galaxy Note re-mamed. I e been a fan of the Note series for over 7 years. It's the only phone I will consider. It enhances my productivity and I've yet to have any type of issue with it since purchasing. You can't ever go wrong with a Note series or rather Ultra series phone from Samsung. Always improving Talk about improving... The camera on the S22 Ultra blew me away with the pictures I was taking. Crisp clear incredible resolution and my favorite setting is Night mode. Color rich saturation that makes it shine with great detail..I would almost say that it's worth getting just for the camera. With the recent One UI update, more features were added or updated to further enhance this device. Die hard Galaxy (Note) Ultra fan for life here. Get one.

This device however far exceeded my expectations. Every game that I played could run in max settings at a phenomenal 120fps. I could just as well multi-task and run multiple games at once if I wanted with no issues at all.

I like the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as a premium smartphone. I also like the 5,000mAh battery, which does provide sufficient battery life , a full day for frequent use and 1.5 days for light use . Talking about the camera setup on the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. I didn't notice that much difference despite a quad-camera system featuring a 108-megapixel primary sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto lens, and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens. One thing I like the most of the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G is the S Pen support, which makes it one of the few smartphones that offer stylus compatibility. The S Pen can be used for taking notes, drawing, or navigating the phone. It made my life a lot easier with the quick notes taking feature. However there is one thing I didn't like about the new phone which is the removal of the audio port for microphone on the Samsung S22. I won't be able to use your existing headphones or external microphones that require a traditional 3.5mm audio jack without using an adapter. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G seems to be a nice device for users who want a premium smartphone with long battery life, and advanced features like 5G connectivity and S Pen support. However, it is also an expensive device. I will give it 4 out of 5 as my final verdict.",4,0,

This smartphone is the perfect combination of power, performance, and style. It is definitely one of the best devices I have ever owned. First and foremost, the S22 Ultra's display is simply stunning. The 6.8-inch screen is incredibly sharp and vivid, with a resolution of 3200 x 1440 pixels. The colors are bright and true to life, and everything just looks amazing on this screen. Whether I am browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the S22 Ultra's display never fails to impress. In terms of performance, this phone is an absolute beast. It is powered by the Exynos 2200 chipset, which is one of the most powerful processors on the market. It handles everything I throw at it with ease, from demanding games to multitasking between multiple apps. I never have to worry about lag or slowdowns with this phone. Another standout feature of the S22 Ultra is its camera system. The device boasts an impressive quad-camera setup, with a 108-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a 10-megapixel telephoto sensor, and a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto sensor. The camera produces stunning photos and videos, with crisp details and vibrant colors. I particularly love the zoom capabilities of the camera, which allow me to capture amazing shots from far away. The battery life of the S22 Ultra is also impressive. The phone features a large 5,000mAh battery that easily lasts me through a full day of heavy use. And w",4,0,

The display is much brighter, and is just as easily viewable outside on a bright day as it is inside at night. The battery, while I've heard it's lesser than the S21 Ultra, is still miles ahead of the 5-6 hours my Note was left with by the time I upgraded (I had never replaced the battery), I'll easily get 8 or 9 hours off a full charge and I'd consider myself a power user with many background apps as well as processing heavy daily tasks. S Pen thankfully has all of the features it did before, I'm one of the few who finds practical use for Air Command when watching YouTube propped on a table and don't need to reach my arm across to skip or change the volume, and especially when taking photos from distances or if I need to hold a specific angle and tapping the shutter button would ruin it (I can't be the only one with that problem right?). Speaking of photos, the cameras live up to the hype on this year's Ultra. I'd heard complaints and gripes since the S20 but when I finally jumped it seems Samsung has ironed out most of those. Point and shoot picture taking, without any fancy zooming or photo modes, is class leading, and while you lose zoom options in the true 108 MP mode having a photo with a ton of detail can be cool and enhance it in most situations. Wide angle is basically perfect, with the great color and deta",4,0,

Well this phone can do just that, the hardest thing that you need to consider is the 100x picks up every movement so make sure to have something steady to rest it on. On top of that, it has WiFi 6 and can take any of the most updated Android/Samsung updates. Being able to scribble notes or draw random pictures and using the screen to watch movies is amazing. The brightness on the screen is great and allows me to see the screen in any daylight. Customizing background, font, colors and being able to browse through themes makes my phone feel like only I have this device regardless of how many other people have it as well. The call quality, integration with Samsung earbuds and the galaxy watch is super smooth. As soon as I turn the devices on, my phone sees them and pairs them right away. Then when I watch to switch over to my galaxy tab s8+ my the os pops up asking me if I'm watching on that screen and allows me to switch over. The battery life on my phone lasts 1.5 days of use but if I'm watching a movie it will cut that down a little, but with the ultra fast charging it charges my device in 2 hours.

Still holding up well a year later. The camera is the best I've ever seen in a smartphone, with great image and video quality even when zoomed in. The screen is likewise the best I've ever used on such a device. The image quality is great, though I wish more things took advantage of it and pushed its refresh rate and resolution to the maximum. There are a few disappointments though. Chief among them is the fact that Samsung finally caved and scrapped the headphone jack and expandable micro SD storage. These have always been big selling points, as I already own a high capacity SD card (that is now useless for my phone), and I'm an audiophile. Frankly, the best Bluetooth headphones will never sound as good as the best wired headphones. In addition to these complaints, I think the battery life could be a little better. It's not quite enough to last all day for a heavier user unless you tone down all the settings. There's also an issue with the YouTube app getting stuck and requiring a reboot to fix; I'm not sure how common this issue is, but I get it quite frequently. All in all, it's a great device, and I'd highly recommend it. I don't think I'll be needing another phone for the next 4 years or so.",4,0,

I had wanted a phone that I could use for personal, work-related, and business. On a personal level, I have loved the camera. Best photos and videos I will treasure of my family and friends. From having access to the camera with click or tap to its detailed editing functions. Boy, has being able to watch great resolution videos been a great pass time. I have been able to watch movies and shows on the go without missing being in front of a television. Before it was a pain not having the phone that was compatible for all the apps I wanted to use. This far, I have used all, like games, restaurant, shopping, banking, email, music, and even work related apps like impravata. One of the top reasons why I liked and wanted this phone was for its Spen. Wether a quick note, drawing, or editing precision, it has made things so much easier for me as a stay at home mmom. While being at work, I can make alerts, timed actions, and keep up to date with my family using its nice features and settings. Also, not that anyone loves bringing home the workload but it has been easier to keep track of things by having easy access functions to items stored in phone or transfered via Bluetooth function. Definitely will say I will always stick to android operating phone.",4,0,

I also use the camera a lot for professional photos and I can say am not disappointed by the results. My only complaint that I do have is that fhe phone battery doesn't seem to last a long time.

Here Are My Thoughts,Max451,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really enjoy my Galaxy S22 Ultra. As a professional photographer the camera is the most important feature I look for in a phone. I upgraded from the S21 Ultra and noticed a significant improvement in the photo's I was getting. Being able to shoot and edit RAW output is definitely a big plus. I plan to upgrade to the Galaxy S23 Ultra mainly for the camera improvements. I also like the battery life and top notch display on the S22U. I can edit many of the photographs I take with the phone and my other cameras right on my Samsung S22U easily, and be confident they'll come out great. I'm very happy with the results I'm getting. A couple small details I would like to see center around ergonomics. It would be easier to use the S-pen if the screen were flat. Also, it would be more comfortable to hold the phone for long periods of time if the square corners were more rounded. But these are minor details. Overall, I've been using Samsung phones for a number of years and have been quite happy with all of them.",5,0,

And Samsung has always come out top of class for such devices. I currently have the S22 ultra, and it's been all I need. It's my laptop, desktop, tablet, and portable entertainment device that I carry everywhere in my pocket when I'm not pressing my nose to the screen. I keep my business organized with the many built in Samsung apps, as well as my social media accounts all kept together so I don't miss anything. I honestly don't know if I could run my business as smoothly as I do today because of this all in one device. I make full use of the S pen. It's my little magic wand that keeps my productivity up, and time loss down. Which gives me more time for gaming lol. Off the clock of course. Since having this, I rarely use my TV at home. I gave it 4 stars only because the battery is awful. For such a powerhouse of a machine, it needs the juice to keep it going. Mine is about shot after 6 months. I know the technology is out there. And I have been careful about battery usage, for as much as my lifestyle will allow. So to Samsung i say: you hit it out of the park with this one. But please improve your battery. Many people like me don't have time to be stuck to a wall or car charger. Thanks Guys!",4,0,

Also the screen and resolution is also a bit reduced compared to the S21 Ultra. Overall great phone and fast processor. Would be nice to move away from the curved edges back to flat edges.

I can play more than one video at once, with audio playing for both at the same time. Screenshots are nice. Front and back cameras are clear and high quality. The display is really good, and the quality is adjustable. The battery can last most of the day. However, doing intensive things like streaming HD videos on YouTube, which is what I primarily do, can drain the battery quicker than usual. High quality games look great and can drain the battery as well. If I'm not watching videos, gaming, or things like that, the battery can last over a day. In extreme power saving mode, I'm sure you can easily get 2 days with limited use. I hate how dust accumulates around the cameras and how hard it is the remove the dust from crevices.

I'm not proud to admit it, but I've dropped it a time or two. We all have, however, When I expected the worst, it would surprise me each time, not one Crack! Next is the POWER!⚡️ Talk about next level! The battery is a tank! It supports my constant gaming that I've come to be addicted to! No matter how long I play, it manages to keep up! Not only gaming, but streaming as well. If I have a binge session, the last thing I'm thinking about is my battery. The S22 ultra has the power any streamer would want before they start their favorite show. To match that is an equally impressive display! The sharpest resolution you'll find in any phone. I could go on and on..literally! Tho you're really not going to understand until you try it! This device has the power and the ability to handle anything you can think of!

Trust me!,Womzie,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the S22 ultra last year and it is by far the absolute best phone I've used. The camera and the speed of the phone is what I love the most about the s22 ultra. I was new into photography and editing and didn't have a camera, but I had my phone. I started using my phone to take pictures and videos. What I loved best was how I could use the different modes (pro, portrait, slow mo, hyperlapse, raw) on the camera app to create different kinds of shots . And you better believe it, each picture and video I took were clear, sharp and stunning. There was no day I took picture for friends that they didn't ask me to send it. When the s23 came out and they used the 'send it' phrase for its intro, I was like that's so true 😂😂. The gallery's editor is amazing enough to compete with paid editing softwares. I did a review for that because I was so happy. It's my go to app for good and quick edits. I also use the lightroom app for Samsung and many other editing tools, and the speed and experience has been great so far. There is no lag, only smooth work from start to finish. OMG! I forgot the pen. The s-pen makes editing so much easier!. it gives that precise touch that every creator needs. It's been a year now since I got the s22 ultra and I have zero regrets.

The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is stunning, with vibrant colors and a high resolution that makes everything look sharp and clear. The 120Hz refresh rate also makes for smooth scrolling and animations. Performance-wise, the S22 Ultra is a beast, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor and up to 16GB of RAM. Apps open quickly and run smoothly, and multitasking is a breeze. The One UI 4.0 skin also feels polished and refined, with thoughtful design touches and useful features. One of the standout features of the S22 Ultra is its camera system. The quad-camera setup on the back is versatile and capable, with a 108MP primary sensor that captures detailed photos with accurate colors. The 10x periscope zoom lens and 3x telephoto lens also allow for impressive zoom shots, and the 8K video recording is a nice bonus. Other features of the S22 Ultra, such as 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi 6E, and NFC, are also top-notch. The in-display fingerprint scanner is quick and reliable, and the phone's battery life is solid, lasting a full day with heavy use.

The sheer brightness of the Samsung logo upon powering on was new to me. This phone has triple the brightness of my previous phone, and let me tell you, it shows. I love being able to use this phone outside and not having to deal with sun glare on thr beach. Additionally, the Snapdragon Gen 1 chip in this phone is more than powerful enough for any task: gaming, mild video editing; this thing is a tank. It once got me out of a crunch at work where I had no access to a desktop to video edit. I was able to use Samsung's DEX to use my phone as a desktop on an external display. It was very user friendly and did not impact battery life. That brings me to my next point... the battery on this phone is amazing. Not only has it held consistent charges through different charging methods (ie. Wireless, Super-Fast Charging, Normal, etc.), but the reverse wireless charging that I can use with my Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and any other devices that need to be charged has helped me out tremendously. Finally, the camera is amazing. Truly, amazing. I have been asked countless times to share my photos with others, and using Samsung QuickShare, I can do that without compromising quality. I have used video and photos shot on the S22 Ultra for professional production, and taking 8k video makes video editing a breeze.

From just a common text or phone call, to streaming on Twitch, gaming, and photgraphing just about anything. The quality that comes from this device is amazing, and even without the memory upgrade I have more than enough room to do all I need. I would say the only reason for a memory upgrade is if you are big into professional photography/videography. I can do all the editing just like I would on my PC directly on this phone. Its a great device, and I wouldn't trade it for anything else... YET 😉 The 5G internet performance on it is amazing, and the bluetooth connectivity is fast and fluent. I hop in my car, I drive off out of wifi range, and rarely have a 5 second delay to transition over to my 5G internet and this baby is working just as fast as it would on wifi. Although I would've liked to see a 3.5mm headset jack, AND a micro SD card expanded memory... Even without those, I have grown to love this device and once you're settled into it, its not that bad and you realize you can live without it.

The cameras are exceptional at 4k. The 8k experience is still in it's infancy stages, but unnecessary given the little options out there to view in native 8k. It's also a bit frustrating to be unable to view Android system files. Other than those setbacks, this phone definitely set the bar for next gen phones with it's integrated smart pen, dex capabilities, responsiveness (although it'd be nice to start seeing phones come with 16-32gb ram options) and camera. Really wish they'd bring back sidesync. That was probably the best application ever made for a phone and the #1 reason for choosing Samsung over iphone. Being able to wirelessly control your phone from your laptop on both windows and mac osx was exactly the thing all phones are missing.

I love the fact that it has so many features and things that can help me in doing my job but then on the other hand being absolutely amazing for playing games, or watching any of my favorite anime shows. This is definitely one of those purchases that you can't understand how you've gone your whole life without having. I love the phone so much that I went out and purchased a new Galaxy S8 tablet this one purchase has converted me to being a Samsung customer for life. I don't see how I can go and start using any other phone ever again especially after the amazing pictures the clarity and everything that it has to offer. Honestly I am working on converting my son over as well, because I already got my wife to convert. She stopped using a competitors brand phone that she had been loyal to for the last decade.

This phone has so many useful features that no other phone has altogether and that's what makes switching difficult. I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years and only now have I been wanting to leave Samsung. The removal of the sd card was a huge deal breaker but that was only the beginning. Since then, Samsung has been becoming beaten by other companies in terms of battery, charging speed, processing power, storage, price, and Innovation. I once believed Samsung was the best overall phone but it's losing all the advantages it had over other products. Now only the vast amount of features on this phone is keeping me attatched. Now about this phone in particular, it has a heating problem. Even running simple tasks causes this phone to overheat to the point where the app it's running closes due to the temperature being so high. As for gaming, I love the big screen of this phone but it lags really bad for the games I play and is badly defeated by a phone half the price of this one.

However, the stylus is garbage. It can never connect and always has issues when using it. My previous model never had issues with connecting to it. It still works when it can't connect, but not having a feature that doesn't work properly for how much the product costs, is ridiculous. Also, God forbid you drop your phone, the stylus pops out and you have to find it which can be troublesome if you are outside. Also, the dead zones! I live in a rural area. Whe. 5g isn't available, my phone is useless. 4g takes over and I can't even get amazon music to work. I have to make sure that I load my Playlist before leaving my home and wifi connection or I have to wait 5 to 8 miles away from my home. Even in cities, the drop offs of service sucks. The features of streaming music does make it seamless for vehicle connection for Bluetooth. Even the option for screen mirroring to my TV. But the phone changing the volume and having to randomly turn it back up on my phone is annoying. Bixby needs improving. If it's going to compete with Google or Alexa, more marketing and integration. And having to turn it off and it being the primary function of the phone , irritating. Finding cases for Samsung phone is a nightmare.

The flagship phone has all the bells and whistles you don't need and some great ones you thought you wouldn't need. For example the 100x zoom camera I thought was a little to much to have. As a person into photography I rarely you that much zoom on my DSLR but for some reason I find myself using it whenever the moon is out or in at my daughter's track or volleyball games. Another thing I thought I'd rarely use is the Spen but for some reason all the documents I sign now with it and not just some typed up signature. The phone is fast to upload and even faster to download. The multitasking is supreme and I've seen it leap and bound over the years from one flagship model phone to the next. Its a solid phone and great multimedia center when away from the desk. I love the colors and the big bright screen that fits in my hand. It's strong and durable it definitely been through some things and will get through some more. I really like the features it just so many I don't want to ruin the surprises....thanks again samsung creators👍🏽,5,0,

I started out subscribed to Instant Ink and used the Instant Ink cartridges, but could only print once before the printer would stop working. The only workaround was to uninstall the HP Smart app on my laptop and reinstall it every time I used it. After cancelling Instant Ink in January 2024, I went to regular non-Instant Ink cartridges. First, the printer and the app wouldn't recognize those cartridges. Then when I had important papers to print and NEEDED the printer ASAP, I decided to sign back up for Instant Ink and installed new, unused Instant Ink cartridges per instructions. The app said I was ready to print but the webpage said my subscription wouldn't start until I installed new cartridges. I did! Then I discovered that HP had sent an email confirming my new Instant Ink subscription and then, 25 seconds later, had sent one saying I had just cancelled that new subscription. I hadn't. At this point I gave up trying to get it to work, so I bought a different printer from another store and another brand (Canon, a flimsy machine that looked like it was a beat-up return to the store) for half the price and it worked without problem. If your brand-new pricey printer doesn't work as well as a cheap used printer that's made of the flimsiest plastic possible, then the problem is you.",1,0,Verified purchaser

I was able to connect it via USB after I connected it to WIFI, as the instructions directed. It has never dropped the WIFI signal. I put my WIFI router beside the printer, instead of leaving it on a lower shelf of my computer cart and I also plugged the printer into a wall outlet instead of a power strip. These are 2 suggestions that I found online when I had problems connecting to WIFI. Though HPSmart was easy to use, there was some confusion because I was not familiar with connecting a wireless printer. A little Internet research helped me tremendously, as my info above shows. It wakes immediately from sleep and prints right away. The color is more true-to-hue than my Canons ever were. I did not want a wireless printer.

But I am glad I took the chance and bought this. I only print a few documents a month and scan occasional receipts for work. This printer meets both needs effectively. MY ADVICE would be to follow the guide for wireless installation. It will basically tell you to plug in the printer and turn it on. Then once it identifies your wireless connection, it will tell you to download the HPSMART app. DO IT! Once you open the HP Smart APP, it walks you step by step though the rest of the installation. It has simple easy to follow instructions and animations. My technical skills are a well deserved joke in my office workplace. But I was able to install this printer in less than 20 minutes. And if it took me 20 minutes, someone with normal technical skills can probably do it in 5 minutes. Print quality is good and scan quality is good.",5,31,

I probably won't use the attachments very much so that's not an issue to me. I've also read reviews where people mentioned having an older model from years ago, and that the new ones are made of cheap plastic. This is my fist Dyson so I have nothing to compare it to, however, it seems very sturdy and well-made to me. I actually do have a smaller rechargeable Dyson that I've had about a year, it seems to be made of similar materials as this large model, and I have been very happy with it.",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Now it won't pick anything up,Fooled,"I bought this thing less than a year ago. Last June, I wrote a review to comment on the hose that won't stay extended. Dyson said, in effect, that I should just use it more. Didn't work. Now the machine won't pick up anything including bits of dog hair on a hard floor. I have cleaned both filters and looked inside the machine to find any obstructions. There aren't any. The hose does have suction for some reason. My one-star rating remains in effect.",1,2,
https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,"Meh. Underwhelming, especially for price",nhmtnbkr,"After using this for about six months, I'd have to say my impression of this vacuum is it's at best average, and largely underwhelming for the purported level of engineering, but most particularly the price. While this is a decent vacuum in terms of the quality of the suction and the lack of tendency to clog, that's pretty much where the benefits for me end, other than the quality of the pet hair vacuuming attachment. Overall for a product coming from a company that touts itself as an engineering company, this isn't terrible well engineered, especially from an optimum function, usability and ergonomics standpoint. There are a number of very glaring shortcomings and a host of smaller, but still annoying others. The extension wand and hose design are two of the biggest things about this that are poor from a design standpoint, but especially ergonomics. The hose tension is way too high/strong, so you are constantly fighting with it to stay extended when you're using the wand and/or the pet attachment - so you waste energy fighting it and it's taxing on the hands to use for more than a couple of minutes, especially if you're like me and have nerve damage in your hands (or you likely would if you're old or arthritic) and you're trying to vacuum carpeted stairs for 10+ minutes. You'll find you end up having to constantly either hold the main part of the vacuum with a hand or a foot to keep the vacuum from snapping back at you when you're using the hose and/or wand, because the hose tension is too high and pulls the body of the vacuum at you. Add in the wand function, which is annoying because it sits inside the hose, so you have to extend it and lock it into the end of the house to use it, especially with the attachments. Or, if you just want to use the hose, you have to pull the wand all the way out and detach it, before connecting attachments. This design is awful in my opinion. What's more, the way the wand/hose assembly sits inside the back of the handle of the vacuum, makes for a sloppy feeling handle when using in regular vacuum function, particularly side to side. You can feel the play between the overly flexible handle assembly and the hose in the back, which means you have to use more exertion than you should to move the vacuum around, especially side to side. I expect that with years of use, the handle, being an incomplete piece of plastic, will eventually snap off. Another major annoyance with this is the the lock mechanimsm to keep the vacuum upright is poor, it routinely disengages and the vacuum falls over, especially when using the wand/hose extended. I've had this fall over and ding furniture, hit me in the head Can't say I'm a fan of the ball assembly to be honest, it doesn't really help with mobility enough, likely because it's too big and creates too much of a pivot point relative to exertion. Because of its size, as many have noted, you can forget about getting it under furniture to vacuum. Coupled with the weight of this vacuum, it's not the easiest to maneuver. Another deficiency on this it the lack of a cord management. Once unwrapped to vacuum with, this has no clip to keep the cord up and out of the way, which forces you to spool the long cord in your non-vacuum pushing hand, so you don't trip, or roll over the cord continually with the vacuum.",2,14,Verified purchaser

The ball swivel mechanism is great, however, it prevents you from easily vacuuming under furniture. The hose is very difficult to extend (and keep extended). Vacuuming one room took longer than it would have with my old vacuum (Rainbow). Pros - suction is like no other - definitely cleans well. Therefore, I won’t give up on Dyson and will try another style. I feel like there are more cons than pros. I will return and try the cordless thinner version in hopes I like it better.",2,11,

However, the floor attachment (roller) keeps falling off from the main vacuum as I vacuum. It’s frustrating to reattach it every few minutes.

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,"The good, the bad, and the questionable.",Just Some Guy,"Our last vacuum was a DC-07. Used it for 18 years. It was a great vacuum overall, and would still be going strong today, but my wife needs something easier to handle due to her bad back. She narrowed her choices down to two vacuums: the Ball Animal 3, and a competitor's. Obviously, given our positive experience with the DC-07, we went with the Dyson, and also because the competitor's model still uses bags (seriously?) which we didn't want to deal with. In terms of engineering, the Ball Animal 3 is impressive. The suction is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's so powerful that in some cases--like bathroom rugs, hallway runners, etc--it's actually a detriment because the rug buckles as you're pulling the vacuum back. My wife likes the head design; it's lower to the ground so it can get into tighter spaces under chairs, etc. I also like that you can see the brush bar while operating the vacuum, so you know whether it's spinning or needs to be cleaned. So as far as engineering and technology are concerned, the Ball Animal 3 is fantastic. The vacuum's Achille's heal, however, is its ergonomics. This is not an easy vacuum to use, and requires a fair amount of strength to push around. I'm 6'3"" 250+ lbs, and by the time I'm finished vacuuming with the Ball Animal 3, my shoulder feels like it's going to fall off, and my back hurts for about a half hour afterwards, from the coccyx up to the middle. If *I'm* this stiff, sore, sweating like a pig, and gasping for air after using the vacuum, imagine what it must be like for my poor wife and her bad back! This vacuum does not ""roll"" or ""glide"" across the carpet, and frankly I also feel it's a lot harder to maneuver. On a positive note, though, the clutch mechanism is in a much more user-friendly location now (an electronic switch next to the power button versus having to bend over and manipulate a mechanical knob); but then Dyson goes and cancels it out by putting the suction adjustment slider in an even more inconvenient location than where the DC-07 clutch knob was. My wife likes the wand on this unit better than the DC-07. I disagree, but I do like that the tools can be directly attached to the hose now. That's probably the best improvement Dyson made, ergonomically speaking. Unfortunately, the main chassis/body still ""follows"" you around whenever you stretch the hose, getting in the way and making the job harder. The on-board storage of the tools isn't very good, either, and seems like it was more of an afterthought. The brush bar is much easier to remove on the Ball Animal 3. It's more of a sleeve that fits over the actual rotating mechanism, so no special tool is required to disconnect the drive belt from the roller bar. Lastly, both filters on the Ball Animal 3 are washable (the post-motor filter on the DC-07 wasn't washable and had to be replaced periodically, and was difficult to access). Now as for the construction of the Ball Animal 3, that remains in question. Some of the plastic, particularly in the handle and the flip-up wand end cap, is really flimsy and bends way too much. I feel like it's going to snap or permanently deform at any moment. However, being open-minded, perhaps the flexibiltiy helps _prevent_ the plastic from snapping. I don't know. Time will tell. I'm torn. On the one hand, I want the Ball Animal 3 to give us 18+ years of reliable service like the DC-07 did; but on the other hand, I am not looking forward to my wife and I (especially her) having to lug this thing around while using it. We may be back in the market sooner than later.",3,0,

Oh and the cord got mangled and gets tangled way faster than any other cord I’ve ever had. Even with wrapping it properly after uses. This vacuum is literally the worst I highly don’t recommend.

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Save your money.,Ahndrayah,"If You like to use attachments, this isn’t the vacuum. If you like to roll your vacuum room to room when it’s off, forget it. The hose tries to keep itself coiled tight at all times- on or off. Even when you stretch out the hose, it recoils immediately. Using the wand and the crevice attachment on the floor kinks the hose because it’s recoiling and can’t handle the angle. Using the attachments pulls the vacuum towards you and it usually tips over. Try vacuuming couch cushions with the vacuum against your leg and an 18” hose. That’s what it does. Oh, and none of the attachments affix to the vacuum. The long wand inside the hose is also awful to try and extricate or replace back in once you finish. The vacuum easily falls from the upright position. It’s only securely in when not being used. Every vacuum I have owned can be leaned back on the wheels to easily move room to room or upstairs. Not this one. It can’t stay securely in the upright position. Bare floor setting is too much suction, because it grabs the floor and makes moving it hard. But try vacuuming dry pet food, and even with all that suction, it just pushes it around.

As many other reviews state this Dyson model has strong suction power. This vacuum has the strongest suction power and cleans dirt that you didn’t even know existed. The trade off for the strong suction power is that you do have to adjust the height on the power head to work properly on your carpet. On my carpet runner I have to set it to the highest level even though the carpet is thin to vacuum because of the power as it try’s to suction up the runner. On larger area rugs with not as high of a pile I can use the medium level and on my fluffy carpet I use the highest pile. On my hardwood floors I use it on the lowest level and turn off the brush bar. I love the no tangle hair brush bar…. Even long curly hair hasn’t stuck on the brush bar. My little dog didn’t care for the pet attachment and definitely don’t try it on your cats! I would say the one thing that I wish Dyson would improve on are the accessories.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hose for stretching the vacuum up the stairs does not come close to the full length advertised. At the full length stretched I can’t get to the last 2-3 steps and at that point the vacuum falls over and starts getting pulled up the stairs. FYI I also find that the upholstery attachment gets the animal hair out of the stair runner rug and carpet better than the stair tool. By the way the upholstery tool is unbelievably amazing. It makes quick work out of getting cat hair off chairs and couches. Truly awesome! This vacuum is so amazing that the less than stellar stair hose does not keep me from loving it.

One side panel came loose just from grabbing an edge of a throw rug, the extra tools were REALLY flimsy and I didn't trust them to last a year. The maneuverability was not the easy glide it shows in the videos, very difficult (for me at least) and definitely not something you can get under furniture.

I love on the hard flooring it doesn’t blow hairs away as it approaches. Sucks them right up. The regular carpeting in the bedroom got way cleaner than I was expecting after one use with this. The only reason it isn’t 5 stars is due to the maneuverability. The suction against the floor (both carpet and hard) is so strong that it surprisingly difficult to push around.,4,0,
https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Good machine but has a poor locking mechanism,Salim,"We have owned a Dyson before and had it for years. The only reason we gave this model 4 stars is because the locking mechanism for it to stay upright, does not stay in place right away. You think it’s locked and turn away but it falls to the ground. This is very annoying and hopefully it won’t cause any long term damage… we have to check that it’s locked before moving away. We never had this problem with the old model. Hope they fix this issue.",4,0,
https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Strongest vacuum I’ve ever used,Beth Foss,"Got this bad boy just after my DC33 died. (RIP bro) I admittedly had to adjust to a ball and it’s general functions, but once I got the hang of it, I was vacuuming everything. It’s capacity for picking up corgi glitter is astounding. I swear, it’s even sucking up carpet padding dust through the carpeting. The no tangle roller and it’s teeth work very well. I haven’t had to pull any hair from the roller. And the smooth removal of the canister is much improved over the last 12 years. These dog brush attachments are fun. My dog hates it, but it’s plenty of entertainment for me and the rotating pet attachment is like a dog hair eraser. At any rate, 10 out 10. Highly recommend for anyone with year round shedders.",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Great vacuum!,SarahD,"This is absolutely the best vacuum I’ve ever had! I have three cats and vacuum A LOT! The hardwood setting is a dream because it means I don’t have a sweep liter as much. The carpet setting sucks up cat hair that I didn’t even know was there and it’s super easy to empty the collection canister. My only complaints are it’s weight, its a little heavy considering how slim the design is and it took a little bit to get the hang of how to maneuver effectively. The hose and million attachments are wonderful! But in order to use the hose you have to unwrap the entire cord which can get annoying, but with it I have been able to clean ceiling fans and every nook and cranny of the house!",4,0,

This one is more lightweight and the suction is absolutely amazing. The pull out attachment is a bit stiff but I think it will loosen up over time.

I use every attachment except the pet brush frequently. I have purchased three Dyson vacuums over the past 15 years and this model is the best one yet. I especially love the 3 floor levels on the vacuum head and how easy it is to change levels. I love all the attachments and have also found attachments from previous models fit this vacuum too. Every attachment makes it easier to use and makes me feel like an expert cleaner. The amount of suction on the Dyson 3 is phenomenal. The only thing I can think of that would make my Dyson 3 better, would be if Dyson would make an attachment to clean blinds.",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Good but disappointing,gezp,The vacuum has great suction as one can expect from a dyson but it comes at the expense of maneuverability in that it is very difficult to push across rugs. It is especially hard on low pile rugs even when you adjust for it via the switch. The location of the switch for adjusting between low pile vs longer and hardwood is on the head of the vacuum so you have to bend over to reach every time which is inconvenient. The hose is also difficult to use because the suction is so strong that the hose doesn’t extend and the vacuum also tips over so the only way I could use it if my partner held the vacuum upright while I tried to stretch it on areas like blinds. Less of an issue but why the attachments are not labeled is beyond me.,3,0,

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Good suction but maybe too much for most to handle,Tracface,This dyson has great suction but I feel it’s almost too much to push on carpet or room rugs. The rugs get sucked up right away and I have to shut the vacuum off and untangle the edge. It takes a lot of strength to push! Also using the wand is hard because it doesn’t want to extend easily because of the suction. It also is hard to put the wand back into the back because it only fits a certain way. We do have dogs and I believe it does a good job on pickup of hair without tangling around the beater brush. Overall it’s a bit much for me as it makes my arm and neck ache.

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Dissapointing,Askooch,"So this vacuum has great reviews and I’ve had a Dyson for 17+ years, so when my old Dyson finally kicked it I thought I’d remain loyal to the brand. I bought this one based off reviews and research I had done online. Seems like Dyson may have paid for positive reviews? What I can tell you is that this Dyson is really disappointing. It’s not that it doesn’t have great suction - it does - but it’s too much. I have a low pile rug and it took a lot of force to vacuum it (and for the record I promise you I’m not a weak human!). Even putting that aside, the handle felt like at any minute it was going to snap in half. It felt like a toy and I was constantly afraid that doing a basic cleaning task would somehow shatter it. I also feel like I have to say that if you keep a fairly clean house and clean semi-regularly then I don’t know if you need this level of auction. Even if you have pets and kids… but I’m a bit obsessive about being fairly clean. I do have a toddler that somehow is always sandy but I still don’t think I needed this vacuum. All in all it was a bummer. I had such high expectations for the price and based off my previous experience with Dyson I was just so disappointed.

It picks up dog hair and dirt/dust so easily compared to our Dyson ball original vacuum. One of my favorite features is that the new vacuum head doesn’t allow for my long hair to become wrapped around. I used to spend so much time trying to cut the hair away! The pet grooming tool is pretty cool and does work with our long haired dog. She’s terrified of the sound of the vacuum, though, so that makes using it a bit difficult. My favorite tool is the pet upholstery tool! It cleaned up the hair from our dog beds really well and worked like a dream on the carpeted stairs. The only thing I find difficult with this vacuum is using it on our VERY high pile carpet, even after adjusting the height on the vacuum head. I assume that’s just because the suction is just too good so while it makes the vacuum difficult to maneuver, it still does an amazing job!

https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,Great for dog lovers who appreciate a clean home!,maggie0116,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum is extremely powerful and great for dog hair. I have 2 huskies that shed a lot and their hair is often stuck on the couch, carpet, and rugs. I previously had a Dyson Ball Multi Floor 2 and I needed to go over the rug a few times before getting all the dog hair out, but I only have to go over it once with this vacuum. Previous Dyson brush bars were a two-piece design that left a small area where the vacuum brushes would not vacuum requiring you go over the same area again to vacuum the missed spot. With this being a single-piece brush bar, the entire width has bristles to remove debris and it makes a big difference. Inside the cleaner head, there are also plastic spikes that clean the hair off the bristles as it spins. This saves a lot of time not having to clean the head and vacuum some places again. The Tangle-free Turbine tool attachment is amazing! It is extremely useful for removing hair on furniture and car mats. It is much better than similar tools used. The initial setup out of the box was tool-free and very simple. Where the cleaner head attaches to the motor has an updated design from previous models so some older interchangeable heads won't be able to attach. The one it comes with has worked for everything we've thrown at it so this isn't an issue, especially, since the head self adjusts between hard surfaces and carpets. Overall, a great vacuum and lives up to the great quality Dyson is known for. I would highly recommend this product to those of you with pets and carpets!",5,0,
