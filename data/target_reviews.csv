I am still learning things this phone does every day but the one thing I love in messages is the ""Check In"" feature!

Phone was shipped to me, and I easily transferred my previous phone's information to this new one. Most of my alerts did not transfer, however, so I'm glad I skipped the step to wipe my previous phone. I kept it and noticed the alerts and could easily update new phone . The only con is that it was not easy to get used to a phone without a home button. I have several app games that keep scrolling when I try to swipe it closed, so my only work around is to lock the phone, and hope that there is an alert on the screen so I can click on that to open the phone. Otherwise I like the larger size.",5,0,

I stuck with this model instead of the pro or pro Max due to the smaller size fits in my hand better. The sound is very good, don’t notice any real difference in picture quality or speed. The one HUGE dislike I have is the side buttons. I bought a normal case, nothing thick like some are, and the buttons are flush with the case. I literally have to use my fingernail and push mightily to adjust the ringer volume or take a print screen. I did not have this problem with my iPhone X.

So plenty of time to get used to it. The things I have gotten used to are knowing that 100% battery life will last me about 2-3 hours of slight use. Knowing that about every few minutes I'm going to have Bluetooth connection issues while listening to music in the car. About once a week it is going to tell me there is moisture in the display port forcing me to use wireless charging despite there being no moisture (poor quality detectors for the charging port). When compared to the phone I switched from (Samsung note 9), the note 9 was better in every category based on battery life, speed, capabilities on running more demanding apps, Bluetooth, and overall quality of the phone. The only thing I can say the S22 ultra does better is its pictures. I believe they sacrificed everything on this phone for a slightly better camera setup than competitors. As someone who doesn't take very much pictures this does me no good. It's hard writing this review given I've been a Samsung fan boy since its wonderful customer service with the note 7, one of my favorite phones despite its rare battery issues, but spending the last year with this phone I can not in good faith recommend this curse to anyone. My only hope is that samsung specifically addresses the battery issues (by far my largest issue with this phone), otherwise I will have no confidence that future phones connection/battery longevity will be any better.",1,0,

It is now Aug 2023 and this phone is complete garbage. For the third time now since owning this phone it has completely lost all forms of service. I cant make phone calls, I cant go on the internet. Nothing. It has said ""Emergency calls only"" for three days now. If I am lucky I can find one small area where I can quickly send a text and hope that it goes through, but thats it. I have done all the resets, gone down the list of issues, messed with the sim card. Nothing helped. I am so done with Samsung. I have 700$ left to pay on this phone and its already garbage.

I would say the screen is tough as nails I've dropped it on gravel face down, from 30ft up on a balcony and into the toilet( don't ask ). I've not got one scratch on the camera lenses through all of that. I do have two problems. The first is a daily reset is necessary due to sluggish performance. The second is that I have serious doubts on the performance of the camera. My work phone is a regular S22 and it's photos are so much better than my S22 ultra.

Hold the power button down for 10 to thirty seconds (sometimes longer) till the phone, tablet or other device that is locked up restarts. Whenever it gets this black screen or frozen problem do this.

While it has many great features, the vibration modes reduces the phones functionality. Specifically, I can barely feel the phone vibrate when it is in my hand without case. This may sound like a minor inconvenience, but I spend a great deal of time in meetings and public areas. Vibration is important. A couple of months ago, per a suggestion from Samsung, I took the phone to an authorized repair center. They told me the phone was functioning as designed. Since the purchase of a Galaxy S III our phones and tablets have all been Samsung products.

Because I have 2 jobs and am a full time student, I didn't have the time to buy a case and I ended up dropping it a few days in. Accidents happen, right?

A light that blinks, or a soft beeping sound. So small and easy to fall away into a Crack or blanket fold.. I do think the pens are one of the top things I like in this phone. The space is incredible, also. Depending on individual preference, there are 3 data space options available. And not alot wasted on space Samsung or your service provider takes up.

There are some features I find unbelievably helpful throughout daily use. Split screen use so I can watch videos and take notes. And the alternative glance feature comes in handy as well. The amount of customization has been wild too. I never really gave much thought to changing keyboard styles or the AOD and I hope one day it gets a full screen option. Battery life has been more than enough to get me through an entire 8 to 10 hour workday easily with roughly 40 to 50% left. But that's mainly due to not needing to use constantly. My one and only gripe is the heating. Without a case you've got your own personal hand warmer and continued use after it gets to that issue, becomes a bit uncomfortable.",5,0,

This S22 Ultra did not disappoint as it was in my opinion a much better version of the note series. Does everything the note 20 ultra did, with more style and a few extra features. The s pen doesn't get enough attention in my opinion but I use it for soooo many things. Simple screenshots and highlighting parts of screenshot before I send to a friend, or Simple note taking, or making lives and gif photos! Endless possibilities. Also, I tried the iPhone 13 pro max when it came out also, I could not believe how people could even put it on the same scale as samsung. Samsung allows you to do multiple things at the same time with such speed and so easy and user friendly. I can minimize any screen or app and put It in a small corner if I want, to watch news or something, while simultaneously online shopping and texting all from the same screen. Can't do that with apple. Just saying! Get the Samsung! Oh!!! And there literally is no better camera. Takes jpg and raw photos if you want to edit and be like a professional photographer with it lol. I am not but my stuff comes out great with the basic settings. I do like having the options to enhance photos though. Great phone. Will eventually upgrade to the s 23 ultra once the trade in value is a tad bit better for me. Tough times mean we can't run out and spend an extra 400 on a phone upgrade unless it's absolutely necessary....sigh*",5,0,

Hate this 22 ultra. It is worse than any ""smart"" phone I have ever used. It has absolutely nothing I wanted or use. I dont care for gaming or streaming or 60 different cameras. I would love to be able to draw my pictures or words and send as a message as I created it. This series seems to want to change everything I say and sometimes just sits and cycles through all the -Home- main screens while I'm not even touching the phone. When my music is playing, while connected to bluetooth devices (my car, headphones) the music stops if the screen goes blank. Never saw anything like this with any other of my Samsung devices. I have always used Samsung but the size of this device alone is a disgrace. Doesn't fit anywhere. The belt clip holder i purchased to assist with this issue is already broken and that's with extreme gentle use as it is clipped to my car vent and never moves. Clipping the phone in, simply snapped the clip on the back. I have complained about this device and all of its issues since day one. My s9 came to an end of life cycle and after using it for 4 years without a problem seriously increases my hatred fir this 22 ultra",1,0,

I also enjoy the Chrome browser as they are pro-active when it comes to security issues. A huge reason is the Ultra fits my hand, as that is a factor that is important as you get older.

The promise and adherence of security updates arriving in a timely and stable manner is what differentiates Samsung devices from other players in the market.

It works well just as a phone too. Calls come through clearly, and I have never had a problem with reception in areas where I have previously had connectivity. Speaking of connectivity it's fantastic that Wi-Fi 6 is packed in and lets me access files on my network at blazing speeds not to mention take advantage of 5G networks to their fullest. Wireless charging is a convenience I didn't know I would appreciate, but it has definitely come in handy.

After using it for a year, I can confidently say that this device has exceeded my expectations. Firstly, the phone's design is sleek and elegant, with a large 6.8-inch dynamic AMOLED display that offers crisp and clear visuals. The phone's body is made of Gorilla Glass Victus and aluminum, which gives it a premium feel and ensures durability. The camera system is one of the standout features of the S22 Ultra, with a 108MP main sensor, a 10MP periscope telephoto lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 3D time-of-flight sensor. The camera produces high-quality photos and videos with exceptional detail, even in low-light conditions. The phone's performance is also top-notch, thanks to the Snapdragon 895 processor and 12GB of RAM. The S22 Ultra handles demanding tasks like multitasking, gaming, and video editing with ease, and the 5000mAh battery provides excellent battery life, lasting a full day with heavy usage. The phone's software is also excellent, with the One UI 5.1 providing a clean and intuitive user interface. The phone runs on Android 13, which is optimized for the S22 Ultra's hardware, ensuring smooth and efficient operation. The only downside to the S22 Ultra is the price, which may be out of reach for some users. However, if you're looking for a premium phone with top-of-the-line features and performance, the S22 Ultra is definitely worth the investment.",5,0,

The pictures are amazing (low light or bright light), portraits are the best, camera zoom is great, the PRO camera, object eraser and videos are just incredible. My battery life is awesome, I can go through the whole day without charging my phone and that is using it a lot on social media, calls messages, gaming, etc. Sometimes even 2 days or 1.5 days all depends on weather, signal strength and other few factors. I love the S-pen, I do not know what to do without it. From just taking notes, handwriting, coloring or even marking stuff in my calender. Playing movies with this screen is so great, and the sound with the Dolby Atmos is amazing. I combined my experience with the galaxy buds pro, that other piece of equipment makes a big difference. When I make phone calls the people ask me what phone are you using, your voice sounds great. Another thing that makes this phone amazing is the accuracy of the ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the screen. Sorry for Apple but even my family with 14 pro says my phone is better and faster. The overall performance of this device is A+. Then the outside looks stunning. The quality of materials, design and colors are unique. Samsung has done an awesome job with this phone.

Don't download more than 30 apps, and don't multitask between 6 apps at once, the phone operation becomes buggy, the keyboard actually gets stuck even if you try to close all running background apps. Once it's done lagging behind you have to restart the phone for a fresh start... Also... holding the side button doesn't like hard reset/power off anymore... it's just a Bixby button... so you have to swipe down twice to get to the power button on screen. I'm quite disappointed overall... This was NOT the Droid I was looking for apparently... may need to switch to the dark side, too bad these things don't have test run options before committing. The camera feature in my security settings got messed up somehow at one point so frustrated to where I ended up factory resetting the phone and then losing all of my backup codes in my third party generators...Bad time.",2,0,

Prior to its announcement, I was the biggest fan of Samsung note series still believe its the greatest smartphone model to have ever been designed. This is a preface to understanding how distraught and lost I was to learn notes were becoming null&void. Then a ray of light was shown the S pen had made its return all was well in the world again u til 5 to 7 mo ths on. At that point the battery became useless, still is useless was a massive let down to ha e SO MANY stunning g and great features,aspects and qualities of this phone to only get to a point to where I now have them all disabled and toggled off sure I have my s pen,but all adaptive modes and personalisation details are gone I now have e what is the equivalent to a Note 6 in all fields its as if this phone was released that year also with my battery being so terrible. Sad part is I decided to purchase and not lease cause it was the notes return and all I wanted but now here I am 2023 and my phone at full charge last maybe 8 hours if I chose to not use it for anything other than text and calls. I'm not alone on this issue as the majority of owners all have the same complaint. So it had the potential to be that masterpiece just wasn't properly executed. Sadly idk when I can upgrade and that idea is followed by if I should stick with Samsung, and ignorantly allow myself to be duped yet again.

In fact, this is the first phone that feels more like Note series. It's been a year since I own it and the phone is rock solid with amazing performance. These days people talk about Cameras when it comes to mobile phones. This phone has great cameras. Wherever I go, people want me to take their pictures using my S22 ultra. I really do not have to brag about technicalities of these cameras. I can say, those who own S22 ultra need not worry about purchasing a new phone until it stops working completely, because the so called new phone will not have anything new than S22 ultra. Without a second thought go for it. It is fast, battery lasts a day, it had s-pen, we can work on multiple things simultaneously on this phone, great speakers, great display, in one word this phone is a package of all the goodies that a mobile phone can have. Go for it.",5,0,

There's a lot to like about the phone: superb cameras with up to 10x optical zoom, a snappy processor, and an amazing display. The display is truly amazing, so bright that it looks great in direct sunlight but is also able to dim for night use while still keeping great color accuracy. The included S pen is surprisingly useful, and it has a lot of hidden features. Not only can you use it for taking notes and drawing, but it also workes as a remote for taking selphies and much more! I also use the pen between the Galaxy Tab S8 and they both work on each other as well. Another neat aspect is Samsung devices have a similar feature to Airdrop that seamlessly shares files quickly and easily. I use the Galaxy Notes app a lot, and especially for a college student, it's handy being able to write assignments on the tablet and refer back to them on my phone, even edit them! In summary, the S22 ultra is a well rounded phone that is great for photography, gaming, productivity...etc. If there's anything to be improved, it would just be a little more battery life, which the S23U already has!",4,0,

Plus, it's water and dust resistant, so no need to worry about spills or accidents! Now, let's talk about the camera. It's got a quad-camera setup that includes a 108-megapixel primary camera, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera. And get this, it's got 100x Space Zoom, so you can get detailed shots from far away! Plus, it can record 8K video at 30 frames per second. Can you believe it? Under the hood, it's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 895 processor, which makes it super fast. It's got 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, so you'll have plenty of space for all your apps and files. And it supports 5G connectivity, so you'll be able to stream and download at lightning-fast speeds. Finally, the battery life on this thing is amazing. It's got a 5000mAh battery, which lasts all day. Plus, it supports fast charging and wireless charging, so you'll never be stuck without a charge.

But the battery life is a bit shorter than what I'd like. I upgraded from the Note 8 but the S22 ultra seems to either have equal or less battery life than the former.

The camera photo quality is near the top of the food chain, but video performance still leaves some things to be desired, namely stabilization and more granular video settings. Samsung pushes out timely updates for their flagships which should be a given. I honestly miss the S21 Ultra I used to have though because it had a more manageable, less boxy design, as well as better speakers.

Overall, I'm pleased with the device as it is fast and does what I need it to do. That said, I have two complaints - the camera and the battery. I have young, active children. They're often running around or doing some sort of activity where I'm promoted to take photos of them. This camera of this phone takes poor action shots. Photos of the kids running, passing a ball, moving in a play are usually blurry. I also have an iPhone 13 XS Max and I know to turn to that device if I want a usable action photo. It's irritating because the Ultra is my primary phone. The battery life is a second chink in the Ultra's armor. At the end of the day, if I haven't topped off my devices, my S22 is usually in the 40-50% battery range while my iPhone is still on the 70-80% range. Yes, the Ultra is my daily driver but even on days when both phones are used minimally, the battery on the iPhone outperforms the Samsung. I get nervous when my battery gets down into the 40s so the difference makes me feel as if the Ultra would be quick to leave me in a bind if I don't watch battery life. Even 20-30 minutes of scrolling news sites in the morning depletes 10-15% of battery. That's far from ideal. The S22 Ultra is a decent device and a good sidekick. I wish its deficiencies weren't as severe because they weaken an otherwise very good device. If I knew what I knew now, I probably would've waited for the S23 Ultra.",4,0,

I like the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G as a premium smartphone. I also like the 5,000mAh battery, which does provide sufficient battery life , a full day for frequent use and 1.5 days for light use . Talking about the camera setup on the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. I didn't notice that much difference despite a quad-camera system featuring a 108-megapixel primary sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 10-megapixel periscope telephoto lens, and a 10-megapixel telephoto lens. One thing I like the most of the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G is the S Pen support, which makes it one of the few smartphones that offer stylus compatibility. The S Pen can be used for taking notes, drawing, or navigating the phone. It made my life a lot easier with the quick notes taking feature. However there is one thing I didn't like about the new phone which is the removal of the audio port for microphone on the Samsung S22. I won't be able to use your existing headphones or external microphones that require a traditional 3.5mm audio jack without using an adapter. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G seems to be a nice device for users who want a premium smartphone with long battery life, and advanced features like 5G connectivity and S Pen support. However, it is also an expensive device. I will give it 4 out of 5 as my final verdict.",4,0,

The screen quality is awesome and the few games I have played and watching video is always a pleasure. The battery life is decent but nothing extraordinary. With normal use of 2hrs of music streaming, an hour or so of YouTube video, and a fee calls and text messages throughout the day I end up with around 30% Battery at the end of the day. Camera quality is pretty good and the optical zoom options are really nice. Navigation of the phone and day to day use are a pleasure generally speaking.

It's not worth the hassle. I've printed about 15 pages total and it's taken me easily 7 or 8 hours of fussing with this machine to get those 15 pages. Buy another brand, please. Purchased this from Target in June 2023 when my old (Canon) printer died. From the beginning, this printer simply did not want to work. I started out subscribed to Instant Ink and used the Instant Ink cartridges, but could only print once before the printer would stop working. The only workaround was to uninstall the HP Smart app on my laptop and reinstall it every time I used it. After cancelling Instant Ink in January 2024, I went to regular non-Instant Ink cartridges. First, the printer and the app wouldn't recognize those cartridges. Then when I had important papers to print and NEEDED the printer ASAP, I decided to sign back up for Instant Ink and installed new, unused Instant Ink cartridges per instructions. The app said I was ready to print but the webpage said my subscription wouldn't start until I installed new cartridges. I did! Then I discovered that HP had sent an email confirming my new Instant Ink subscription and then, 25 seconds later, had sent one saying I had just cancelled that new subscription. I hadn't. At this point I gave up trying to get it to work, so I bought a different printer from another store and another brand (Canon, a flimsy machine that looked like it was a beat-up return to the store) for half the price and it worked without problem. If your brand-new pricey printer doesn't work as well as a cheap used printer that's made of the flimsiest plastic possible, then the problem is you.",1,9,Verified purchaser

I was able to connect it via USB after I connected it to WIFI, as the instructions directed. It has never dropped the WIFI signal. I put my WIFI router beside the printer, instead of leaving it on a lower shelf of my computer cart and I also plugged the printer into a wall outlet instead of a power strip. These are 2 suggestions that I found online when I had problems connecting to WIFI. Though HPSmart was easy to use, there was some confusion because I was not familiar with connecting a wireless printer. A little Internet research helped me tremendously, as my info above shows. It wakes immediately from sleep and prints right away. The color is more true-to-hue than my Canons ever were. I did not want a wireless printer.

But I am glad I took the chance and bought this. I only print a few documents a month and scan occasional receipts for work. This printer meets both needs effectively. MY ADVICE would be to follow the guide for wireless installation. It will basically tell you to plug in the printer and turn it on. Then once it identifies your wireless connection, it will tell you to download the HPSMART app. DO IT! Once you open the HP Smart APP, it walks you step by step though the rest of the installation. It has simple easy to follow instructions and animations. My technical skills are a well deserved joke in my office workplace. But I was able to install this printer in less than 20 minutes. And if it took me 20 minutes, someone with normal technical skills can probably do it in 5 minutes. Print quality is good and scan quality is good.",5,31,

Paper constantly jams. It constantly disconnects from the wifi. It worked on our phones for a while and now even when it says it’s connected it won’t print come to find out if you don’t pay for their membership they can basically not allow you to print. It said my printer wouldn’t work unless I updated my billing information. I prefer to purchase my ink and paper from the store but apparently that isn’t an option. Would have never bought this printer if I knew it would give me such a hard time. Unable to return so it’s basically a very expensive paper weight or door stop at this point. Save yourself the time and money and do not purchase this printer.,1,3,

My broken printer works better broken than this one does brand new.

(There isn’t) Worst of all is the print quality— or lack thereof— blurry, not crisp in any way— looks like a mimeograph from 1975. Just awful. I knew for the money that the printer itself (the physical form) was going to be cheap, but the quality makes this printer unusable. I can’t even use it for basic tasks, it’s so bad.

Nowhere does it specify that this printer cannot connect to wifi networks with wpa3 security. I just assumed that a modern day printer would be able to do this. The printer also did not come with a USB cable to connect it directly to my computer, so I had to order a cable separately. I am annoyed that I will not be able to use the wireless printing feature, which is literally the reason that I bought this particular printer. If HP is incapable of making wireless printers that connect to all types of wifi networks, the very least that they can do is include a USB cable so you can actually USE the printer.

It’s as if you need to re-set it up each time you use it. If you’re looking for something where you set it and forget it, this is the opposite of that. Haven’t printed in a month? Prepare to spend 30+ minutes troubleshooting. You’ll also be constantly buying expensive ink (every 100 pages or so) and they try to force their ink replenishment down your throat without telling you what it costs. Their cartridges contain a chip so you can’t get them replaced cheaply. Looks like a deal but is a bad value.",1,17,

The HP Smart app is very easy to use and includes many, many great templates. The printer was very easy to set up and navigating the print options are very easy to understand and navigate.

The instant ink is an awesome program that sends me ink but also lets me recycle old cartridges easily through the mail.

The printer came with a 6 month trial of HP+ Instant Ink. Which is really nice. But also a little confusing. Because you don’t receive ink every month. It’s only sent out when your printer shows low ink. And that’s fine for me. I don’t always print a whole lot. The only thing that bothers me is that the printer doesn’t hold very much paper.

I have not been out for a good time in two years and the minute I get out; someone sends me a printer I have been trying to review for over a year. I am now just coming out of a holiday coma. So, here is my review. I received the HP Deskjet 2700e printer. It has been over ten years since I received a new printer, so there are several things I was not familiar with in new printers. It was very light and did not feel like a printer. I was able to plug it in and the instructions were easy to read. It took me a minute to find the load paper station and install the cartridges. Because it is storming where I live, the Wi-Fi is slow, and it took a minute to connect the printer to the computer. I was able to install the HP smart and explore the options. The first page I printed was the test page and then print my driver’s license to send it off for my birth certificate. It was nice to scan the front of the driver's license, turn it over, scan the back and print it on one page. As far as the HP instant ink program, I think it is a good idea. When I go to buy ink, I always forget the type of printer and/or ink number. With the ink program, when the printer is low, it ships the ink and no more trips to the store. I do not like that the program wants to me to put in my credit card information, even though there is a trial run. Most times, I forget to cancel the trial end and will get charged. At this time, I gave the printer a grade of B. I think as I get used to the printer, I will like it more. Disclaimer: I received a special deal on this product for providing my feedback.",4,0,

I ended up having to reset the setup but once I got it done it's been a great printer. There's no streaks in printing, works fast, and the quality is great, both in black and white and color. I think the instant ink and paper subscriptions are great, especially how your printer will recognize that you need them and presto!

I'm sort of in the middle. I definitely would've appreciated more instructions. Considering my last printer was one I had for many years, the way you set up a printer now is definitely different than how you do it today. I think the instructions could've been a lot more helpful. I did eventually figure it all out but it was a little stressful for basically a first timer. This printer is very nice looking and is not bulky at all. It fits in the space I have for it perfectly. The white makes it look very clean. Over the month or so of having it, it's been pretty easy to familiarize myself with it. There is an HP app you use to keep track of how it's functioning and to manage the Instant Ink subscription. It's helpful but again I feel it could explain things a little more for the first timer. When I ask it to print it does so quickly and proficiently. It makes copies the same way. I love that I can count on it. The Instant Ink subscription is very well priced and extremely convenient. I don't have to worry about monitoring my ink levels so I know when to order more ink. You can pick a price depending on how much printing you are planning to do in a month and they just send you ink when you need it. They also have the option to add paper too. I love not having to worry about ink or paper, it just comes right to my door! I would highly recommend it to anyone, it is so innovative and unique.

I was a little skeptical about the Hewlett-Packard Brand because I had a printer from them before that did not perform very well. This one is OK, good for a basic things like printing out word documents or shipping labels, which is pretty much all that I do. I usually print out in grayscale as well. I would not recommend this for photos, and I don’t like that you cannot do an automated double sided printing. But overall, for the discounted price as well as the instant ink option, I am satisfied. It is the size you would expect and has a good Wi-Fi connectivity. Instant ink option is a wonderful idea because I do not print out very many pages per month. I just wish there was a number between 10 and 15 that I could purchase for the monthly income out because my total runs between those two numbers. I am glad to be on that system now again instead of paying so much for ink and having to go out and buy it.",4,0,

From jump it's got a sleek design and is compact. Then the excitement grew once I seen that I received the HP instant ink program for free. Bonus!!! However once I tried to connect it to my account I had some difficulty doing so. I also had a hard time finding contact info to contact HP for assistance. Once I did it was pretty straight forward and they even linked to my computer to walk me through. Hands on customer service. They even gave me an additional 3 months of instant ink service. The HP instant ink program is very innovative in the way it functions. You don't pay for ink which is a huge price relief. You only pay a subscription fee for pages printed. It's like a monthly allotment of pages that can also roll over to the next month if you didn't use them all. And you only pay a all fee if you go over but I haven't gone over mine and I've had rollover so far. Just have to be realistic and if your say a teacher don't go for the smallest package lol. Plus having the extra premium additions is nice. They have their own dedicated support for HP ink plus premium members. It's all inclusive and the other areas of HP are aware of your a member and direct you to that department right away. It's amazing, and I couldn't be happier with the service. the customer service is top notch. So now to the printing. The quality is nice and I like that everything is very vivid. I do wish that it was quieter because I do print a lot at night and don't want to wake the whole family. I also wish that the paper load was done from the bottom like previous printers but this was ok too. Just not able to hold as much paper so I had to keep loading it. I was a bit concerned with the construction of the unit and wheather or not it would hold up against my young children and their inate ability to destroy things by looking at them. So far it's stood up against them. Surprising as it is to believe, this printer is also pretty light. I really didn't think it would be so light. Overall it's a great printer and am telling everyone about it.",5,0,

It was pretty easy to install. Ink cartridges and all. The hardest laser was getting the printer to connect with my wifi. Set up couldn’t be dim on my computer, so I had to download app and do everything on my phone. Connected with wifi and was able to print. Pretty decent prints of black and white AND color. Up to 100 sheets of paper per load is cool. I really like the subscription because I’ll never have to worry about running out of ink as it is all monitored. That is a plus! The insta ink program is defina plus. I love the fact that I’ll never have to worry about running low on ink and the prices for ink are way better than purchasing from stores.

I got the box and began to install the printer. I love how easy it was to install on my phone and laptop. I do a lot of scanning at work and home, so the scanning feature was a definite plus for me. I also print a lot of papers and can say that while this printer does a nice job, you don't want to print a lot of pages at one time. This printer does print double sided and that's a big plus for saving paper. It's easy to navigate the buttons and it has a sleek design. It also has a few other nice things. For one, it's easy to install the ink cartridges, and the quality is very nice for a basic printer. The ink program is a great asset because you get the ink that's right for your printer, mailed to you in the convenience of your home, and you don't have to worry about traffic jams or bad attitudes. It's simple to use and affordable. If you are looking for a starter printer with good quality, then I highly recommend you give this printer a try.",4,0,

But, besides that it is the best printer I've ever had. Also very lightweight. Now let's talk about the ink program....this is the best thing that comes with the printer. 6 months of ink program !

The sleek design and color will match any decor in home office or any room of your home. The printer was very easy to unbox. It was easy to set up and load with paper. Putting the HP ink cartridges in was a breeze. I had it turned on and using in about 30 minutes. It easily connected to my wifi, and I had the HP Smart app loaded and ready to go. I loaded the paper. The paper was a little challenging at first, but I found the slider and moved it with ease to where it needed to be. I began by printing a couple of pages out. The prints moved easily through the printer. The printer picked up the signal to print very quickly. It isn't a fast printing printer, but it moves very smoothly though the unit and gives a very good print. I have printed some black and white copies as well as color copies. The ink distribution to the copy paper is amazing. The HP Instant Ink program is excellent. It was so very easy to download the app and connect the printer to the app. I love the thought of never having to worry about running out of ink. The HP Instant Ink program makes sure you never run out of ink. I love the concept. I find it very useful especially when I am busy. I don't have to take extra time to run to the store for ink. Also the HP Instant ink app is easy to use and has excellent additions to it. It really helps make my printing copies easy and quick. I have also used the scanner which scans very nicely. I used some photographs, and it picked them up quite nicely. I would say that this printer is easy to use. This printer looks pretty in my living room on my desk. It would be a great printer for students and adults as it is very easy to use. I would highly recommend this printer as a starter printer for anyone using it for simple scanning and copies.

It is a compact size and the paper tray on the back and front can be slid down and closed while not in use. I like that,to avoid unwanted dust build up. The ""set up a new printer"" process took me about 30 minutes to install 2 HP printer apps on my phone and to figure out how to connect my smart phone to the printer. The apps are very user friendly and it can print out troubleshooting tips if needed or if the printer notices it is not connecting right away. I was surprised it just printed the instructions after tapping the ""i"" button on the printer! It really is a ""smart printing system so your printer is always ready""! I also like that it can connect with bluetooth and print from a different room. Installing the ink cartridges was easy because it says open the packages once ready and avoid touching most parts of it. I just wait until the printer starts up and the pieces of the inside go back and forth a few times and once they stop in the middle it is time to push and press the 2 ink cartridges into place and done! Then you are recommended to run a printing diagnostic test. It is a paper that prints many different lines to show it has calibrated correctly. After these steps, it is ready to print. I was able to set up the printer with my home wifi very easily. The printing quality is very impressive and vibrant!! When ready, I can go into the HP Smart app and there are so many options: Instant ink service, printables, shortcuts, mobile fax, camera scan, help&support, print photos( most used tab), print documents(2nd most used),printer scan and Copy! The scanner and copy feature is amazing. I found this very user friendly! I can scan bills and documents electronically for better safekeeping and love to organize it all. Sure beats digging through my file cabinets! Can also scan precious family photos and send directly across the country! The HP instant ink service was included with this featuring 6 months free delivered directly to my door. That is such a great feature to include! Overall I really feel like HP is there to help me through all steps of set up and maintaining my printing experience!",5,0,

And it takes A LOT to impress me when it comes to printers as I’ve always had THE WORST luck with at home printers. First off, when I lifted the box it came in to set it up I realized just how light it was. Barely weighed anything. I then took it out and realized that it is such a sleek, good-looking printer. I am in love with the white color. Next up was the set up. EASIEST set up of any printer I’ve ever owned. Total time to set up? About 5 minutes. And most of that time consisted of just downloading the app and setting up my HP account. Now I started printing. I loved that the input tray allows for 60 sheets so I don’t have to keep refilling it as often as I did my printers in the past. The quality of the printing was the real star though. I loved the “crisp” look of the printed images. And it printed very quickly: up to 7.5 pages per minute in black and up to 5.5 pages per minute in color. But the pièce de ré·sis·tance? The Instant Ink Subscription!!! Game changer! The ink or toner cartridges will be shipped to me only when needed, so I will never run out and I will only get what I need. Nothing extra. And finally, my tree hugging self LOVES that prepaid recycling service is included with it. So basically I now have a stress free, dependable printer and I couldn’t be happier! Thank you HP!!!",5,0,

While connecting to the app it had an error then it took over 30 times of me resetting and unplugging the printer to finally get the app and printer to communicate with each other. Then I could not get the printer to print the alignment no matter what I did it did not do it. I had to leave the printer for 2 days before it automatically printed out the alignment when I went to print something else. By the 3rd day, the printer was working as I wanted and expected it to. Even with the shaky start, I do really enjoy this printer. Since it connects via wifi I don't need to have wires connected or even be in the same room as my printer. I have my printer connected to my cell phone as well as my laptop. As a homeschooling Mom, I love the ability to be able to print worksheets and lessons as soon as I find them when browsing especially from my phone. The scan feature is another feature I really like as it gets sent right to the app quickly. I can even scan to print copies. This printer does everything I need. Included with this printer is a subscription for 6 months of HP+ instant ink. After a few days of registering my printer, I received an email that my first shipment of ink is on its way. This is perfect as it means once the ink that came with the printer runs out I will have its replacement all ready to go. It keeps track of everything for me I don't need to stress out or worry about running out of ink again. I love this I didn't think I would like it but I really do it. It even has an optional service for paper. If you are someone like me who is constantly printing, paper and ink are the last things you want to run out of. The quality of everything I print is wonderful, I have even printed pictures. At first, I was very frustrated with this printer and thought I would hate it when I had trouble setting it up however, once I got it all working I now can't imagine my day-to-day without it.

The white color will certainly go with any motif and looks great next to my brick walls. I do wish you could personalize the appearance of the printer (like have one with your face on the printer or a favorite pet, etc) yet I would definitely recommend this printer to anyone seeking a good printer. It scans, prints, and is Bluetooth compatible. It is pretty durable, too. Definitely worth getting! I just wanted to touch on the Instant Ink.

Plus the quality of the prints is phenomenal as well. The ONLY thing I would change would be to have a feature where when you start to print, the door automatically opens, and the little arm that holds the pages, swings out by itself. I know that other printers have that feature and this one does not. Outside of that though, it's very easy to print, no matter if I'm on my laptop, or even directly from my smart phone. Printing is always available to me wherever I might be at the time, plus I am able to get up to date information in regards to how much ink/pages/etc I have left to use before I need to order replacements. In addition to that the Instant Ink+ Feature is fantastic! It's really comforting to always know that I don't have to worry about ever running out since it's constantly tracking the level, and once it gets low enough it alerts HP to send out a fresh cartridge so we can continue printing and moving forward with our day. Just another handy feature that sets HP apart from the rest of the printing options that are on the market. All in all, small in size, but DEFINITELY powerful in delivery, love this HP Printer!",5,0,

The setup was a breeze with the easy to see and use screen. There aren't any confusing or complicated buttons. It is a simple setup and a simple printing process. The printer cones with black and colored cartridges to get you started. I like the streamlined design that doesn't take up too kuch space. I like the easy to use panel and the consistent printing that hasn't had any jams. I am most pleased with the long range of wireless printer thst I can use if I am in other rooms of our home. I would recommend this particular printer to someone who has basic printing needs and doesn't need all of the bells and whistles of larger and more extensive printers. What makes this printer unique is the HP ink renewal program where you get ink for your printer in time for your next batch of printing needs when it runs low. You won't run out because the printer keeps tabs on how much ink you have left and reorders your ink to be delivered before it runs out. This is extremely useful and convenient for someone trying to juggle everything that is hoing on and still have the necessary tools to complete tadks, such as printing. I really like the HP instant renewal because it hives my printer a step up on printers of the past. Always being stocked on ink is important to me and my need is fulfilled.",5,0,

The printer was fairly simple to set up with my computer and phone. Using the printer was also easy and nothing was overly complicated or difficult to follow. The image looks great and prints very smoothly. I think the ink system is my favorite though because with their ink subscription service you never have to worry about running out of ink. HP was even nice enough to throw in a 6 month subscription for free! Overall, this is a great little printer at a great price and can handle all your printing needs at home!",4,0,

Some of my favorite features are the included free 6 months of instant ink, which allows you to connect your printer account and your ink levels are monitored and when you’re running low, they automatically send more! I love how compact and not bulky it is and that it only has 1 cord to plug in. It is a very basic printer with 3 main functions including printing, copy, and scanning ability. The printed page prints out very clean and neat with no smudges or runs. I also love the remote printing and protected pick up, which requires your phone to be within a certain distance before it will start printing. The only downside i can say is the printing speed. if you are going to be printing a lot of pages or things together, just make sure you have an extra few minutes to spare l. Overall it’s a great basic printer and i would definitely buy again and/or recommend to friends and family!",4,0,

This is a great printer for a small space and everyday use. I have set up with the ink program, 6 months free, which is also great because that means I do not have to keep an eye on if the ink is running low because it is automatic and I don't have to run to a store to see if they have the ink I need in stock.

It's been great having a printer here at home. I have found that having a printer at home has been very useful and it gives me more time to spend doing other things. The Wi-Fi compatability is amazing! I love how it comes with the HP Instant Ink program as well. Having the Instant Ink program that comes with the printer makes this purchase even better.

Before I even knew the ink was running low I had received a delivery of ink. It is nice that the printer seems a status report back to HP with the level of ink and HP send the ink cartridges in the mail right away. The quality of the printing it not bad. I am not printing pictures or Anthony that requires high graphics so it fits in well for homeworking. I was able to print about 55 pages back and front with black and color before ink ran low. 1 feature I would of like it to have I 2 sided printing automatically and not have to do it manually. Other than that I would recommend this printer to any household.,5,0,

I do much less printing now, about five pages per month, so when the quality dropped drastically 6 months in and new ink cartridges didn't fix it, I contacted HP's help chat. After over an hour and a half of troubleshooting, the rep gave up and ended our session with ""I tried all my ways to resolve, thank you for your cooperation."" I'm on the HEAVILY pushed Instant Ink plan, so I was also charged for the many, MANY test prints the rep had me run while we tried to solve the issue. The print quality now is good enough for a recipe, but I just tried printing address labels and the clarity just isn't good enough to use them.

My kids are extremely hard on toys and these little babies have held up great! We originally bought one for our 4 year olds birthday and it was such a favorite that we ended up buying 2 more so that all of our kids could ride together. It’s great fun, therapeutic, and bonding time for them. We added aftermarket clip on led headlights and taillights for them so that they can night ride when the sun sets earlier. Every child that rides it falls in love. We have recommended them to family, friends, and neighbors and can’t say enough good things. These babies definitely will get your kids feeling like the coolest kids in town. Lots of stares of admiration from passerby’s and neighbors. We enjoy watching our kids smiles and laughter while they ride these. We are an adrenaline junky family and own several adult and youth machines and for the kids these are hands down the most durable and zero maintenance (if you know you know). Eventually brakes would have to be changed out but that’s nothing that will need to be done for a few years and is an easy change. Out of box set up is minimal and simple. If you’re sick of rebuilding cheap and expensive plastic powerwheels, these dirt bikes are your answer! Pull the trigger and go for it. Affordable, durable, and an absolute blast for all who ride them. Battery life on a full charge is probably about 30 minutes of continuous riding up and down hills. Do not let the suggested age fool you (liability purposes, youth machines always overstate the age limit) If your child can ride a bike well at 3 or 4 they can handle it just make sure you are along side them to train them to use the hand brakes and not whiskey throttle. I would say age range is more fit for ages 4-9 at best.",5,11,Verified purchaser

We got the idea from some neighbors who had some older brothers and they kept getting handed down to the younger siblings. Now, we have a younger motorcycle club that rides around the neighborhood nonstop. The battery lasts what seems to be all day with them riding it on and off, so we have no complaints on lengthy charge times or short ride times. They never complain they are dead. In fact, it may have been completely drained 1 time and she was worn out from riding it all day anyway. Also, my 12yr old daughter also likes to ride this bike but she looks funny because it is almost too small for her, so I agree with the other reviews that you want to buy a bigger bike for a 13+ year old. l..

The Razor MX350 is pretty cool while it lasts why I say that is because my brother took the Razor MX350 to the extreme way past the maximum extreme and made the chain that the motor uses to drive the rear wheel came off and the Razor MX350 would not move at all after a few weeks or maybe longer someone was able to fix the Razor MX350 and they told me that it was fixed just it only wold go really slow because it had not been changed in a long time. So I plugged it in and the next day it went it's top speed of 14 mph and the only problem was that the battery did not last anything close to 30 minutes and it was fully charged so I though the battery probably got damaged. So it is pretty cool while it lasts ????,4,7,

OLED TVs May Be Addictive,OLED Fan42,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Our family has enjoyed LG's OLED TV platform in our home theater for the last few years. OLED offers amazing picture quality, and the whole family appreciates the breathtaking images. An OLED TV in a dark viewing room is breathtaking-- the inky blacks do not disappoint. We decided to replace the TV in our great room, and after a lot of checking, it became evident that there are not a lot of options for high-quality small TVs that include features like Dolby Digital. And, while I started looking at other platforms to ""expand our horizons,"" we landed squarely back in the OLED camp. I appreciate that LG has made this unit with some thickness to it. Our other OLED TV is so thin as to be almost impossible to handle. The stand is well designed, and the cable management is a nice touch since this particular unit is not wall mounted. Because of the efficient stand and bezel design, we were able to gain significant screen area compared to the older LCD TV that it replaced. My only complaint with the LG is the welcome screen icons/apps are a bit much-- a clean design would be a much-welcomed upgrade. (Same with our previous OLED unit from LG.) I didn't realize just how clunky the interface is since our previous unit is connected to an AV processor that handles most of the system control. This unit is a freestanding unit with a couple of connected components. The unit's software works well and provides control of all the connected components fluidly. Also, the cable cover on the rear of the TV doesn't handle multiple HDMI cables very well. That's a minor issue. Again, our only complaint is we wish LG would create a cleaner user interface... but I bought it for an amazing picture. The interface is just an annoyance.",5,0,

When I was looking for new and bigger TV, I saw that the LG C3 was one of the highest-rated OLED TVs on the market. So, I decided to purchase it. The setup was a little complicated, especially turning off the annoying Voice-Assistant that doesn't shut up (hard to find the setting to turn it off). I initially used the Picture Wizard to customize the picture. However, it seems as though my choices resulted in faces being too orange. So, I had to do it a 2nd time to tame it down a bit. I prefer a very ""warm"", vibrant picture, that really captures the colors of the images shown. I also had issues with some TV shows that are older in nature (non-HD), with resolution. I had to mess with settings in order to correct it, but it is still not great for these older shows. As far as modern shows go, having gone from regular HD to OLED 4K, I expected to have my socks blown off by the picture, but I did not. The picture is decent, but doesn't excite me for a TV that is rated so highly. I had originally wanted to purchase a different brand that is known for its highly-touted picture quality, and perhaps that is what I should have stuck with. The LG C3 does get the job done, but it isn't impressive in my opinion.",3,0,

The different picture modes are great and I love that gaming mode automatically activates when the gaming system is turned on. The picture itself is absolutely top notch. My complaints are relatively minor critiques. I do not find the screen saver feature very useful. It allows you to display artwork or a clock etc, but I would prefer my TV to just be off when I turn it off. This means you have to hit the power button twice to actually power off the TV. The remote is a bit cluttered and could be a bit more minimalist in my opinion. Dedicated buttons for streaming services seem ambitious given how much change we are seeing with those, and a full numeric keypad is a bit archaic. While the TV supposedly is compatible with Google Assistant, the assistant is not built in and even after linking my LG account to my Google home, I have yet to be able to get Google Assistant to control the TV in any useful way. Again, I am overall very satisfied with the product, these are just a few small things that keep it from being truly five stars.",4,0,

The TV kept turning itself on spontaneously, sometimes in the middle of the night. After trying very hard to figure out the issue (including changing out the entire main board), the Geek Squad concluded the problem may have been the ""magic remote."" It is complicated to use (who makes a remote without a pause button that is easily accessible???) and not intuitive. If this could be made more user friendly, it would enhance the TV.

What users need is a full-size comprehensive manual with pictures explaining every control and feature and how to use them. A pictorial menu tree would be helpful as well.

https://www.target.com/p/lg-65-34-class-4k-uhd-2160p-smart-oled-tv-oled65c3/-/A-88196023,Probably the best Mid Tier OLED,Atlas23,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This OLED is in my opinion probably the best mid tier OLED tv you can buy right now. (Especially with the good deals going on around the holiday season) It has great brightness, amazing color and of course the True Black levels are perfect. It’s got 4 HMDI 2.1 ports which is great so if you game on a next gen console you won’t be disappointed. So far I’ve had zero issues and the tv has been perfect. I know a lot of people say OLED tvs aren’t good in bright rooms that get a lot of sunlight but my living room is pretty bright and gets a good amount of sun and even when the sun is shining through the room the TV is still completely fine to watch things on. Of course if you want to enhance the experience I suggest just closing some curtains to the point where there’s no direct sunlight on the TV. It is definitely not as bright in the sun as it is at night but regardless don’t let it steer you away if you have a bright room and still want the experience of an OLED. OLED is an experience unlike any other type of tv that is out right now and it is 100% worth the money especially if you watch a lot of movies. That said, I’d highly recommend going with LG for the best bang for buck OLEDs. If you don’t wanna completely break the bank but still want a high end OLED then LG is the way to go. Especially the C3 Cheers",5,0,

Terrific resolution and contrast in terms of picture. I like the smart features. A 55 inch. was plenty large enough for our living room. It took awhile to get the Alexa to link when setting up. And, we have yet to figure out how to get the free three month trial of Apple TV+. (I was able to link to the one week trial, but will need to call LG promotions office later today. The only downside of new TV is that my wife hates having to deal with four remotes (one for Directv box, one for external sound, one for Roku, and one for LG TV). While we can certainly consolidate these remotes, and we can use Alexa to get to different devices, the process of learning how to do this is beyond my wife. So, we stay with four remotes.

https://www.target.com/p/lg-65-34-class-4k-uhd-2160p-smart-oled-tv-oled65c3/-/A-88196023,Incredible Picture and Features,LGSpence,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] LG OLED is THE BEST 4K television picture hands down. Very realistic rendition of all video and sports look the best! You cannot compare the true black and vivid contract that you get by having no back light like other panel displays. The features are easy to use and remote can be used a s a mouse by simply pointing in different directions on the screen. Great for navigating the built in web browser, and remote control microphone also does speech to text so you don't have to type in web searches. You can also link the TV to other devices like Alexa and I have it set up to show family pictures as a sreen saver. The built in free LG TV channels provide additional content and I also use an over the air antenna with it to over 30 free local HD channels. The HDMI 2.1 eARC is the latest interface and works flawlessly with Denon Sound Bar and SubWoofer. The TV even listens to you room when you set it up to optimize the sound. Consider the LG Sound Bar if you are buying both at the same time. The LG Sound bar and TV have additional interface features including music streaming that are better than my Dennon. I bought a smaller one for the bedroom because the backlight on our previous TV made the room to bright. i do wish that remote had backlight for that room. but that is solved by using the microphone button to switch channels and even set the sleep timer. You will not regret buying this TV !",5,0,

I got the slightly larger 77"" C3 in the same spot (using the same LG slim wall mount!). My first use not only had a superior picture but I the audio was fantastic. My soundbar had Dolby Atmos capabilities but the older TV was before eARC HDMI and only had a subset of Atmos. The true ATMOS sound filled the room with truly amazing sound. The picture is brighter and has true colors. I'm not sure how a picture could be better. Especially when the source is 4K Dolby Vision with Atmos. And the setup was easier than my older OLED as the updated LG OS recognized my soundbar, Blu Ray, and Apple TV through plug and play. The one downside is that only the higher priced G3 has the new ATSC 3.0 tuner.",5,0,

As a self-proclaimed TV aficionado and an unapologetic snob, I've traversed the landscape of Sony and Samsung, only to find my true allegiance lies with LG's OLED marvel. In a tale of technological evolution, OLED emerged as the beacon of brilliance, leaving other manufacturers in the dust. Sony and Samsung, once pioneers, found themselves trailing in the wake of LG's supremacy. Having embraced OLED with unwavering confidence, LG emerged not just as a participant but as the clear victor in the grand theater of visual delight. My journey with LG's OLED TVs has been nothing short of a love affair, and this marks my third dalliance in a mere two years. Slowly but surely, I am ushering these wonders into every nook of my abode, transforming mundane spaces into captivating realms of cinematic splendor. Brace yourself, for disappointment has no place in the presence of an LG OLED. Yet, let's address the nuances. This TV is a virtuoso tailored for the realms of streaming 4K content and gaming ecstasy. It dances with pixels and breathes life into digital landscapes, inviting you to immerse yourself in a visual symphony. However, it might not be the ideal companion for cable aficionados. If your TV aspirations extend primarily to the world of cable, you may find yourself yearning for more. In essence, the LG OLED transcends the mundane; it is a portal to visual nirvana. As I replace each television in my humble abode with this unparalleled gem, my conviction remains unwavering — LG OLED is not just a television; it's a testament to the zenith of viewing pleasure. Elevate your entertainment experience, and let LG OLED be the maestro orchestrating your visual symphony.",5,0,

Speaking of passwords, thankfully pretty much every app had a qr code making setup so much easier.

The crisp, bright picture is remarkable and it’s bright regardless of room atmospherics - literally I don’t think any other brands have something comparable to this screen technology. The viewing angle does not make a difference in picture clarity. The sound from the internal speakers is surprisingly good, voices are clear and has a good amount of base- probably the best internal tv sound I’ve ever heard. The only thing that made me rate it four rather than five stars is I’ve not been able to stream picture and sound via the HDMI connection as I could on my previous (2018) LG tv. It doesn’t matter what type of cable or HDMI connection cable I use, it just doesn’t work. A big disappointment considering I like to stream hockey matches through my laptop and I can only use my laptop speakers for playback. The tv recognizes the computer connection, but no settings or adjustments to any settings resolve the lack of sound. It’s surprising considering I did this successfully on an earlier non OLED LG television. Otherwise outstanding performance, easy to connect a cable box, a blue ray player and to connect a soundbar via the digital optical cable.

This TV makes any content I consume look absolutely sublime. From video games to streaming, even SDR content looks and feels like HDR. I always recommend LG OLED TVs because they are simple to use and feature-rich. Airplay is seamless for streaming. The apps launch quickly compared to other smart TVs' interfaces. I love the features they added to the 2023 models. Picture by Picture finally works with physical HDMI inputs, which is great for PCs and gaming consoles. The new audio, live paintings, and minimalist clock are beautiful. It truly turns this device from a TV into an ambiance piece. The design is absolutely elegant. The thin bezels with glass really add to that allure and aesthetic. Surprisingly, the built-in TV speakers are quite good. But the eARC connection is even better. I did not have any issues with the TV remote controlling audio on my soundbar from the LG OLED remote. The smartphone app is quite convenient because it allows you to control the TV without relying on where you placed the physical remote. One of the best features of the TV is that it supports Dolby Vision along with G-Sync. Gaming on the console and PC is a blast. The blooming always bothered me on mini LED televisions. Since this is an OLED, the response time is <1 ms. It is amazing. Motion clarity is fantastic. I earnestly look forward to LG OLED TV's yearly release because I love seeing the technological advancements. It's still going to be a while before this quality becomes the norm. But I'm grateful OLED technology has finally become affordable. In real life, once it's set up in your home theater, there is no comparison to IPS or VA panels. The clarity, response times, and vibrancy of the images are remarkable. If you are unsure, 100% go see one in person. It's a little tricky to tell in showrooms with bright lights beaming on them. But if you can go to the home theater sections or see the TV in the dark, that's where OLED truly shines, and the difference becomes extremely obvious. The depth in the image is not replicable with Mini LED due to the lack of dimming zones.

It heats food and drink fast, and is well made: good design, made of quality parts, and assembled properly with certain quality assurance methods in place. It is a sturdy unit that doesn’t seem the least bit chintzy or cheap — this microwave was not made with the bottom dollar in mind. It has sensors to ensure proper cooking and cook times, a convenient timer, and a clock. I especially appreciate the express cook one-button time cook 1-6 for 1 to 6 minutes of cooking, and the button to add 30-seconds to the cook time is extremely handy, too. I use it frequently, more so than I ever would’ve expected to, and I really enjoy and appreciate the convenience it brings by its thoughtful design by people who are obviously forward-thinking and have the consumer in mind. I would recommend this microwave to anyone who thinks product longevity is more important than just getting the job done as cheaply as possible and prefers lasting products to those that are made to be thrown out and replaced when the cheap components quickly fail. The same folks who would rather pay a little more for good quality and utility of an appliance that will last nearly a lifetime, as opposed to the least expensive option that still looks modern and in-style, but the enamel chips after a month of use and causes arcing for most of its service life… *cough*cough*I’m looking at you, Emerson!

That can also be a good thing. The button to push open the door is oddly flimsy. If you push on one side of it, that side will depress while the other side doesn’t. When the door closes, both sides of the button are polished back out. It seems to heat things well. I have waned usome things and have used the defrost too. I haven’t tried any of the “auto cook features. It is a good size (1.4 cu. ft). It seems a bit deep, so it takes a bit more room on my counter. That isn’t a big deal for me.

It satisfied all of my requirements for size, inside space, and cooking power, it has the ease-of-use options I wanted (eg., quick start cooking for 1-6 minutes, ""add 30 seconds"").

Most other low-cost microwaves require you to enter the ""number of potatoes"" after pressing the potato button, and an often-inaccurate cooking time is then calculated by the microwave (since it doesn't know whether you're cooking mammoth or tiny potatoes). This microwave just senses the humidity to determine when the potatoes (or popcorn or leftovers) are ready. That's my kind of cooking!",5,0,

I'm counting on the reliability of the GE name and the fact that this item is fairly comparable to the older model, for the new microwave to be as durable (as today's resources and standards seem to allow). The door of the new model is so much lighter, I already see the need to be more delicate with handling, especially when closing it. The two latches that lock the door are made of plastic and seem flimsy. If not careful to align the door properly, the top latch pulls closed before the bottom, which seems to put more pressure on the plastic piece as the bottom of the door bends slightly outward.

Cooking results are excellent. My only complaint is the shortness of the electric cord--only 3 ft. long when my previous GE microwave oven had a 4 ft. cord, which is much more practical. The explanation given in the manual is the shorter cord is a safety feature so folks don't trip over the cord. Get real!! All the shorter cord does is make it necessary in many if not most cases for the consumer to use an extension cord, which is potentially much more dangerous. I used a grounded extension cord, but not every consumer will do this. The shorter cord seems like an example of a solution searching for a problem.",5,0,

https://www.target.com/p/ge-jes1460dsbb-1-4-cu-ft-black-counter-top-microwave/-/A-90238388,The Old One Worked Better,whathasnotbeenused,I am a bit confused with this microwave. We actually purchased this particular microwave because it was very nearly the same product we previously owned. However our previous microwave was over 20 years old and was making noises so we thought it probably should be replaced. So we decided to stick with GE and something as similar as possible to what we had originally. However this microwave takes longer to heat things than the older one did. It seems to need preheat time. When you microwave something the first time it is hot enough or done but if you then microwave a second item immediately at the same time and power level it seems ok. Simple things I used to microwave in the older one got hot much quicker but I have to keep putting things back in the new one. I am using the same time and power levels I have always used. So I am not sold on this new one but I guess it is what I now have. Also the older model had a more textured exterior which looked nicer while this slick exterior looks cheap.,2,0,

The only think I miss is that it does not come with an instruction book, or at least a ""quick start"" card so that you can fully use all of its features right away.

Sometimes I make nachos with the liquid cheese heated up in the microwave then drizzled over the chips and a tablespoon or 2 of sour cream to dip. Of course I still like them plain, but I generally always have them with at least some salsa. Nice compliment for enchiladas and refried beans too. I don't like the unflavored tortilla chips at all, it's always nacho cheese flavor!!",5,6,

https://www.target.com/p/doritos-nacho-cheese-flavored-tortilla-chips-14-5oz/-/A-13319564,why crushed chips,Dorito man,ok the reason why I review this product as a % star is because of the taste but as far as the chips they are a 0 star its because they are all crushed and in crumbs because they don't care when they stock them they try to get as many on the shelf as possible so when they fill the shelf to the end the push the bags back as hard as they can to fit more on there target needs to stock it instead of the delivery guy because they will put on as much as they can its not us they care about they just want to sell as many as they can which is fine just make room for more dont crush the custumes product if they do just return it they will learn,5,3,

I changed my diet, made sure to brush my teeth after coffee - nothing seemed to help - stains always started reappearing around 5 months from my last cleaning. Then I switched back to my favorite toothpaste - this one! I've only been using it about a month, but the stains have virtually disappeared without a professional cleaning.
