8K video

Capture more detail with 8K video – the highest recording resolution available on a smartphone. It’s not just another outing with friends, park days in the sun or a weekly livestream. It’s recorded as an ultra-bright and razor-sharp memory – including details that make it amazing

Super-steady Video

Video you capture is effortlessly smooth, thanks to Auto Focus Video Stabilization. Now, your nature shots, dance videos and laughable moments will be clear, steady and unforgettable. 1

Nightography

Some of the best times happen when the sun’s down. Nightography lets you snap or record every single moment clearly — anytime, anywhere, regardless of light. Night Mode has you covered.

Portrait Mode

Skip the glamour shots. With Portrait Mode, your favorite faces (even your pet’s) never looked better. Keep your subject in the spotlight with up to 3x the optical zoom, enhanced image processing and intuitive features. So when the light hits just right, you can start a pro photoshoot on the spot, no matter the distance between you and your subject.

108MP photo resolution

Bring out the detail of every hiking backdrop, sweeping cityscape or group photo with premium detail. Ultraclear 108MP is the highest resolution available on a mobile phone, turning your pics into unforgettable moments.

Bright Display with Vision Booster

Take your must-see content to the next level with a bright display. Whether you’re editing video, staging a shot or simply streaming your favorite show, Galaxy S22 will make it all pop. No matter what’s on screen, every pixel will be silky smooth with an adaptive display that automatically adjusts up to 120Hz — even at max resolution. And it will all be easy on the eyes, thanks to intelligent blue light management.

Adaptive Color Contrast

Streaming on the go, working from your patio or binge-watching late into the night? An adaptive screen on Galaxy S22 automatically optimizes color and brightness, indoors and outdoors. No matter what route your day takes, it’s always a scenic one.

Long lasting battery

Your answer to the dreaded low battery. Galaxy S22 Ultra and Galaxy S22+ intuitively manage your usage to conserve energy on their own so you can go all day and into the next. Share when you want to, stream when you want to and never miss a moment. 2

45W Super-Fast Charging

Life is happening right now, so don’t let a low battery get in your way. With 45W Super-Fast Charging, you’ll quickly get charged up so you can dive back into action. 3

Embedded S Pen

The iconic S Pen is now embedded with Galaxy S22 Ultra. Unleash your creativity and productivity with S Series. Sketch and bring your ideas to life. Edit photos and videos with pinpoint accuracy. And do it all with that pen-to-paper feel.

Premium design and craftsmanship

High design for everyday life — that’s Galaxy S22 Series. With a classy, eye-catching glass-metal-glass design, we’re setting a standard for smartphones. Strut your style in chic, sophisticated colors like Burgundy, Phantom Black, Pink Gold, Green or Phantom White. With our strongest aluminum frame and the latest Gorilla Glass, this smartphone is lightweight and durable to help endure scratches and dings.

Live Sharing With Google Duo (Co-Watching)

“You’ve gotta see this!” Everything’s better together. Share thrills, smiles and all-out belly laughs with friends when you co-watch YouTube from anywhere. Viral video group-watch parties are always better when they’re enjoyed with your faves. 4
