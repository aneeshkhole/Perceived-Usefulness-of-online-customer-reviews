3317,3317,16,AMAZON16, 1 step forward 1 step back,Flea5711,"Jedi Survivor was a good sequel to Fallen Order. In some ways it got better, in some ways it got worse. Overall I think it was a good game, but not great. I usually write my reviews with 3 categories: story, characters, and gameplay with story being weighted the most. As always, small spoilers may exist so read with caution.

Story 8/10

Ok. If you have a star wars game, and the story is halfway decent, you are going to get a good grade. The story revolves around Jedi Cal Kestis who escaped order 66 and continues on with the story from Fallen Order. The story isn't bad. It fits within canon pretty well. Similar complaint as I had with Fallen Order. I think there was some opportunity to show established characters from Star Wars canon but they didn't. That's ok. Overall I liked the story. It wasn't a bad story. Hunting down this ancient Jedi was a cool thing, plus fighting marauders is always nice. I won't spoil anything but the motivation of the final bad dude is kind of ...weird? I think I liked the story of Fallen Order better though, only slightly.

Characters 8.5/10
Like i've said, I wish the developers had used some more established characters in the star wars franchise. I think that would have given the game more depth and impact. But for the most part these characters seemed to be invented for this game. It's excusable but a missed opportunity nonetheless. That being said, the characters they did use were good. I generally think Kestis is a bit boring. Merrin takes more of a central role in this game which I liked. Overall I think she is the most interesting character of the series and I liked they fleshed her out more. Cere, his advisor more or less, also pretty milk toast in this game you see her kind of grow into that classical Jedi sort of character. Greez, the pilot is a good side character. Lots of comic relief, and enough development that you are still invested in him. I really liked Bode and thought his character arch was interesting and well done. BD-1 is a great little droid. Star Wars always does good with their droids and he's no exception. Characters had good back stories. They weren't overly annoying so you were invested early and wanted to know more about them. I liked Rayvis a lot better as a villain than Dagon. Dagon was just kind of...annoying? Rayvis I thought had a much more interesting backstory. Overall it's a really good cast but none of them just blow me away.

Gameplay 6.5/10
I just think this is where the game took a huge step backwards. First off, one of the worst things about Fallen Order was the terrible platforming designs. Well they got worse here. If I had a counter for the number of times I died, 99% of them would be falling off something. Not the combat or a really tough boss. Level design was the big baddie here. The abundance of puzzles and their designs were a big detractor for me too. I'm not a puzzle guy. And these were just frustrating at times and most of the time, kind of pointless.
The battle system was largely the same as FO which is good. I enjoyed the battle system in this game. They added a few more bells and whistles which was nice. I generally think they could have had more interesting force powers than what they had. But in general not too shabby.

Overall. A very solid 8/10. The story was good not great. Perhaps it was helped some by the fact it was in the Star Wars universe. The characters were memorable and interesting. No character flaws that were just ridiculously annoying or anything. I still think Merrin is the most interesting character in this series. Overall the gameplay was enjoyable but for me, the puzzles and platforming of this game took away from the excellent battles and action elements. I give it the same score as I did fallen order but I think I give fallen order the edge overall. FO has the better story, Survivor does a better job with characters, they both kind of suck when it comes to gameplay but survivor sucks a little more. Or maybe it's because I'm 4 years older and less patient than I use to be?",4,0,False,0.519871992,0.153049795,730.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,46.5,0.6563636363636363,4.6,amazon,0
3318,3318,17,AMAZON17,List of Changes (Compared to the Wii U version),Vincent,"This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:

1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original

2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl)

3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item

4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth

5. ""Smart Steering"" A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.

6. ""Auto-accelerate"" for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral

7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup

8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against

9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on

10. Online Play.
-Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the ""Y"" button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.

- You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early

-When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match

- More icon packs for tournament mode

11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen

12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo

13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game

14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages

15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc)

16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match

17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:

-Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.

-Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell

-Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs

-Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out

-Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it

==Additional notes:
- There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps

-There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players

-Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse

-No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down

-No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo

-Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced

-Other balance changes:
Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.

Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on

If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked.

Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shell

Easier to break while drifting (advanced tactic)

-Luigi still has his signature death stare

If there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.

Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision",5,0,True,0.417699571,0.102763017,1164.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,0

3367,3367,17,AMAZON17,Woohoo! Deja vu!,rodjoh,"Mario Kart 8 was a great game on the Wii U and it is still the best Mario Kart ever released.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe brings all the fun of the original version plus adds a few more features to it.
The game looks as beautiful as ever, and runs smoothly. Perhaps even better than on Wii U due to the higher resolution supported by the new hardware.
Now, and this is probably the thing I like the most about it, is that we finally have a console-quality Mario Kart game to play on the go. While all the portable Mario Kart games have been good enough, the console versions have always been superior by far. The fact that we can fit the entire Mario Kart 8 experience in our pockets now is a reality feels surreal.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe features all the tracks, characters, DLC and features from the orginal straight from the box. No unlocking... well actually scratch that, you do have to unlock the kart parts again. But all tracks and characters are ready to go from the start.
If you never played MK8, you can expect a great arcade racing game with all the crazy combat action you can expect from the series. There's a few things you need to know.
- Coins are back. Collect coins across the tracks to increase your max speed.
- New items such as the Boomerang and the Pirahna Plant.
- Antigrav mechanics, now you can ride your kart even on walls and upside down at certain sections.
- As in Mario Kart 7, vehicles can be customized. You can glide through the air and drive underwater as well.
- Mario Kart 8 for the first time in the series features cameo characters and tracks from other Nintendo games such as Zelda, Animal Crossing, Fzero, Excitebike and Splatoon.
- Go all the way from 50cc up to 200cc for the first time. Yes, it is crazy fast and makes the game a lot harder than you'd expect.

The Deluxe version brings a revamped Battle Mode that is actually fun to play, with the classic modes Coin Runners, Shine thieft, Balloon Battle, Bob Omb Blast and more. This definitely makes the experience feel more complete. It also brings back the ability to hold 2 items at the same time which hasn't been done since Gamecube's Mario Kart Double Dash.

I don't know if the existance of this port means that Switch won't get its' own proper MK9. Hopefully it still does. Right now this is too much deja vu for my liking. But I do love MK8 and while I was ready for something new at this point, I'm just happy I can take this excellent gem wherever I go.",5,4,True,0.494590931,0.198412152,447.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,1
3368,3368,17,AMAZON17,"Hi, I'm Daisy!",Transcendent Sacred Courage,"Yeah. I main as my girl Daisy. Since Mario Kart: Double Dash!

Regardless, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the gem of all Mario Karts. From its graphics, elaborate levels and challenges, this game is great for those who play alone or with friends and family. Since I play alone, I have no judgment on the multiplayer aspect. However, my prediction is that it's nothing short of fantastic!

All five modes are readily available: 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, Mirror Mode and 200cc. In some courses, especially on 150cc and 200cc, prepare for immense frustration, as the CPU will undoubtedly pummel you with an onslaught of items such as Red Shells, Green Shells, Blue Shells and Lightning. If you lose first place, it's very difficult trying to get it back; the CPU this time around are merciless. Unfortunately, for every console Mario Kart to date, I've always had to deal with the CPU's ruthless assaults. Especially if I'm in first place, which I usually keep. Advice: always try to have at least two items. One on the back of your kart and the other one for safe keeping.

200cc is where the real challenge lies; not only must you be wary of your opponents and environment, but your driving skills should be nothing short of superb. Otherwise, it's off the track you go! Or at the very least you'll keep bumping into obstacles and going off road if your drifting and braking simultaneously is terrible.

The soundtrack is very diverse and wonderful as well. I appreciate all of them, yet there are ones that are conspicuous more than others: Electrodrome, Rainbow Road, Bowser's Castle, Thwomp Ruins, Shy Guy Falls, Dolphin Shoals and Wild Woods. Beautiful compositions, as well as the overall environment.

There are over a dozen characters to choose from. Some less original than others. I say that because those slots could have gone to other original characters that could have either made a first-time debut, or a return. Double Dash was the only Mario Kart where each character had a unique special. Unfortunately, these don't return in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

Different vehicles are prominent, each with different stats that could make or break a race for you: Traction, Handling, Weight, Acceleration and Speed are all the stats. Find the right balance. Unlockable vehicles, tires and paragliders will become available the more coins you collect.

Overall, I love this game. This is my favorite Mario Kart to date; Double Dash's throne is now overthrown, placing second. I intend to keep playing. Start racing with anti-gravity today!

3378,3378,17,AMAZON17,Mario Kart 8 DX,Steve G,"Listen, if you've ever played a Mario Kart game then you know what you're getting into. It's Mario Kart, but it looks better than ever. It includes the 4 cups from the original game's DLC, bringing the total tracks available to 48. Nintendo is also releasing a $25 DLC that is adding an additional 48 tracks, doubling the base game's size. It's a bargain.

If you enjoyed unlocking characters, I have some bad news for you--they're all unlocked from the start. The only secret character is Gold Mario, which you can get from getting a gold trophy in all the 200cc grand prix. And the 200cc is available right when you boot up the game for the first time. Kind of a letdown if you like unlockables. Kart options unlock as you collect more coins through gameplay. This maxes at 5000 coins and gives you a golden glider. If you beat the 150cc and Mirror Mode (available as soon as you boot up the game for the first time) you get a golden kart. If you beat the staff ghosts in the 150cc time trials you get golden wheels.

I was skeptical at first, but listen... it's Mario Kart. It's just fun.

3380,3380,17,AMAZON17,King of The Road!,Mariofan105,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the most visually impressive Mario game of all time, has the most content of any Mario Kart game, but does that make it the best?

Pros:
- Massive roster of characters!
- 48 tracks!
- Beautiful graphics (out does the Wii U)
- Stats menu is much better done
- You can hold 2 items again (this is a major game changer in a great way)
- Boo item and feather return
- Menu looks better
- Controls are simple
- Many different control options
- You can play 2 player as long as you own the Switch since the Switch comes with a pair of Joy-Con controllers
- Battle Mode is back and better than ever!
- Nice variety of Battle Mode battles
- Music is wonderful
- Online seems to work great

Cons:
- Smart steering is annoying to keep turned off, very easy to turn it on by mistake
- Still no proper trophy celebration
- All characters and tracks are unlocked from the start of the game except for 1 character

As you can see the pros really out weigh the cons by a lot! I was not a big fan of Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (I wrote a review here on Amazon), but I can safely say that every major flaw that game had has been fixed perfectly with this game! And I failed to mention one of the biggest pros and that is the fact that you can play this game anywhere! The Nintendo Switch allows you to take it with you and play this game wherever you want, and you will always have 2 controllers with you in case you want to play with a friend.

The Nintendo Switch is a safe buy for any gamer, we already have Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and now we have possibly the greatest Mario Kart game ever made! Not to mention the impressive lineup of games we know that are coming for the Switch later this year. I'll end this review now, as Bowser and I have some races to win!

3391,3391,17,AMAZON17,Best Mario Kart Yet,Clare,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is some of the best fun I've had in a while. I myself had skipped the Wii U entirely, but I had played the Wii U version at friends' houses. This is the definitive version of Mario Kart with a great mixture of new tracks and remastered old ones. And the added bonus of all the DLC tracks is pretty sweet too.

Graphics: 5/5 This game runs at 60fps on and off the TV and at 1080p on the TV and 720p on the screen. For comparison, the Wii U version maxed out at 720p.

Gameplay: 5/5 The different ways to race (antigravity, glider, and underwater) make this game both fun and difficult at some times.

Battle Mode: 5/5 If you are a Wii U owner this is probably why you would purchase this game. There are several new battle modes (Renegade Roundup, Bomb Blast, Shine Theif) that give you something else to play besides the usual coin runners and balloon battle.

Controls: 4/5 Some control schemes are better than others, but all of them are solid options. When I'm playing single player I like to use the joycon grip because the L and R buttons are bigger than when using the SL and SR on a single joycon.

Music: 5/5 All of the tracks sound great and I love the emphasis on saxophone (I'm a sax player myself). On the DLC tracks like Zelda and Animal Crossing it's cute to see how they revamped the classic tunes for racing. And on the Cloudtop Cruise course you can even hear some hints of Super Mario Galaxy's Gusty Garden theme.

Overall this is a great game and a must have for the switch, especially if you've never owned the Wii U version.",5,1,True,0.480764579,0.190584416,289.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,1
3392,3392,17,AMAZON17,Great classic game back and better than ever with modern updates!,C. Taylor,"Pre-ordered from Amazon for the Switch, and it's our favorite game, so far. Not going to lie, MARIO nostalgia runs big in this family, and even the next generation is already a big MARIO fan. All the great aspects of the classic MARIO Kart games have been preserved. The battles, the races, the ability to edge out your opponents with banana peels, turtle shells or a good old fashioned side swipe. There are tons of classic Nintendo characters to chose from, as well as courses from other Nintendo franchises. Let's just say Link for Zelda is a favorite for one of the kids. As parents, we enjoy battling each other in some good, healthy competition. Oh, I should mention the graphics look great on our tv, too!

My only complaint is more to do with the game system than the game. Initially we played the game with a pro controller and the joy con L/R controllers locked into its base to make it work like a pro. The left joy con kept shorting out like it was having an interference problem. We had to ditch the pro controller and each use one of the tiny Joy Cons (I used the left and husband used the right). It fixed the issue, but they are so tiny they aren't as fun to hold like that. However, I have noticed the L joy com joy stick act a little funny with other games, so I'm not docking a star as it may be more of a Switch issue. I have read about other Switch owners having a similar problem. My advice - if you can afford the pro controllers at the hefty $69.99 a piece price tag, buy two of those to play this game.",5,0,True,0.413445378,0.178396359,291.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,0
3393,3393,17,AMAZON17,Love,CaptainK,"Mario Kart is always a classic that I love. Fell in love with the original Wii version and this one is much better. Some of the maps you'll recognize but many have new twists and there are new maps to race. I love the battle games as well. (Balloon Battle is my personal favorite) Switching to two or more player mode is easy. (When you first try two player, for some reason the settings will be all turned on such as the safer driving mode, so drifts don't work as well, and the players kart will always be hitting the gas, and in battle mode that's not convenient so make sure you turn those settings off). And online playing is a welcome addition. You can choose between regional and world. There isn't a 'Grand Prix' in the online racing, just one race at a time. And playing Battle online, there's just one round at a time, no 4 rounds and then a winner is decided. Also there's no picking which battle game you want to play, it just cycles through the five. At first I didn't like it but it forced me to get better at games I didn't really play often. In the online playing there is a personal point system. You start out with 1,000 points and depending how you rank each round, you can either earn or lose points. (Got down to 988 and back up to 1250). While the console comes with two controllers, I find myself considering buying another set because I don't like the feel of playing with one controller, as it's so small. Also I keep tilt controls off cause I find it makes me lose control.

3397,3397,17,AMAZON17,"It's Nintendo, It's amazing",Just Me,"I will start with the bad:
1 and 2 actually have to do with the setup of controllers rather than the game.
1. If using separate the right joy con sync button is millimeters from the use item button.
2. If using separate the home button to go to the main menu Is very easily pressed if younger player is using the controller or someone with bigger hands? I could easily hold it differently but I also wear an xs women's glove.
3. Not enough new content for those who had the original MK8 since release which I know is the minority of people. I've only had MK8 since August and played maybe a dozen or so times and while I love MK8D for pure nostalgia and clean entertainment, just like I still play MK64, I wouldn't otherwise. It would collect dust and would make me angry that really there's nothing new racing wise. Pickings are slim for games on the switch a few new tracks really would make a huge difference in most people's minds.

The good:
1- My 4 year old finished in 4th in a race 8th overall! No one had to finish playing then do her 3 laps! She didn't give up in frustration halfway through a tournament. No complaining that she lost. The auto acceleration and steering is amazing.
2- Perfect family game.
3- I am not a techie but whoever says the picture quality is pretty much the same is crazy! Or they need a new tv. I have a 4 month old Samsung 1080p tv 42 inches and the picture quality is amazing.

3401,3401,17,AMAZON17,"A Fun Racer! If You Love Mario Kart, This is for You!",Lynn Ledger,"I'm so happy to be playing Mario Kart again! This was my game when I was younger, and having it now just brings it all back! All of the tracks are gorgeous and fun to play. There's enough of them with enough variety where everyone will find favorites. The wide roster of characters to select from add to the fun! I never expected to be playing Link in Mario Kart ever, and had a blast as him! I've already dabbled in the battle modes, and those seem just as entertaining as I remember! It sounds like the WiiU's version was lacking in this department, so I'm glad they made the improvements. It's nice having the option to bank up 2 special toys to use on your competition from the mystery boxes, and I find it fun unlocking customization for my Karts.

Its an exceptional game that I'm glad got a port to the Switch from the WiiU. It is an older game though, so some who already HAVE it from the WiiU days may be a bit disappointed in not getting much fresh and new with this installment. I'd give it a 4.5 Stars if I could simply because it is an older game that people have already on a different system. I'd like to encourage Nintendo to have Switch era games available/developed like in the case of Zelda Breath of the Wild, so I believe a mild dock of stars would be appropriate.

3402,3402,17,AMAZON17,Fast Fun for All Ages,TMSjokeman,"Love it! The five stars almost don't feel like enough. Everything about this game is fun, and the challenges keep coming with new moods exclusive to the Nintendo Switch!

If you have ever played MarioKart before, this is more of the same - fast, fun, and never-ending excitement. I don't think your the person I need to sell on this.

If you have never played Mario Kart, and you have a Nintendo Switch...I mean, what are you waiting for??? Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is not just another racing game - you race underwater, through the skies, upside down, through a toybox; there is so much to see and do and learn here. Plus, there is a learning curve, and the game is designed to help you become a better racer gradually, while still letting you take home the Gold cup. Single player is great, and playing this on the go with the Switch is ideal because each race is never longer than 5 minutes total. You could easily power it up in the doctor's waiting room and probably finish a few Cups before being called back.

And the multiplayer is great! There are other features designed to help even the odds between veterans and new-comers. From the Grand Prix to the Battles, it's anyone's game to win! The online is much more challenging, but after completing all the 150cc cups with Gold, you should be set to take anyone on.

If you have a Nintendo Switch and don't have Mario Kart 8, you should question why you bought it in the first place.",5,3,True,0.489754143,0.221645568,259.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,1
3403,3403,17,AMAZON17,"BEST MARIO KART, IF NOT GAME, EVER!",Dudley,"Sorry for the all caps, I just love this game. I had always wanted Mario Kart 8, but sadly I never owned a Wii U.

There is a very wide variety of tracks, being 48 in total (32 from the original game and 12 from the dlc). All the tracks are creative and have their perks, as with any Mario Kart game.

BATTLE MODE IS BACK! There was a battle mode on Mario Kart 8, but it was famous for being lazy (It used race tracks from the game and only had balloon battles). This is all fixed in Deluxe, with eight dedicated battle courses and five battle modes, all of which are amazing.

There are new/returning characters such as Bowser Jr., King Boo, and INKLINGS! Still no Birdo or Diddy Kong, though.

The graphics are updated to 1080p and 60fps docked, from 720p and an odd 59fps on the Wii U.

There are very few flaws, those being small things such as the coin item being too prominent or Pink Gold Peach being a character.

This is the highest reviewed Mario Kart game to date, with the highest first day attach rate. It broke the first day sales record of Mario Kart Wii. This game is AMAZING!

I didn't even mention double items! They are a game changer!

It is very accessible for new players with options such as smart steering and auto acceleration. The only problem is that they are very easy to toggle on, so be careful.

I would definitely recommend. 10/10!",5,0,True,0.579799268,0.07547181,246.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,0

3421,3421,17,AMAZON17,"Even though it's a port, it's a great game.",SodaPop,"As a Wii U owner, I was disappointed when Nintendo announced Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Nintendo Switch, a port of Mario Kart 8 for Wii U. I bought Mario Kart 8 and all its DLC, only to be greeted by this! Nonetheless, I decided to purchase the game to strengthen my game library. (The 20% discount from pre-ordering through Amazon Prime helped sweeten the deal.)

Now that I have played the game, I decided to review it so I could tell everyone every major thing that is new in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (MK8D), and, if you owned the Wii U version of Mario Kart 8 (MK8U), whether I think it's worth the upgrade...and the $60.

Note: if you aren't a MK8U owner but own the Nintendo Switch, then stop reading this review and buy MK8D! It is a must-have in the MK family. The game will be a brand new experience for you, and you will love it!

Now let me tell you about all the major changes in MK8D.

- The game runs at default 1080p and 60 fps in TV Mode, in contrast to the Wii U's default 720p. (In Handheld and Tabletop modes it is reduced to 720p. When there are 3 or 4 players, it is reduced to 30 fps.)

- You can play MK8 ANYWHERE, with ANYONE, at ANYTIME!

- All DLC from MK8U is included in MK8D.

- Every thing is unlocked from the start, except car parts and Gold Mario.

- You can now hold two items at once, which was one of my favorite elements of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! The Double item box also returns from Double Dash.

- There are two new items: Boo and Feather, which is exclusive to Battle mode.

- There is a third level of mini-turbo, called Ultra Mini-turbo and represented by purple sparks.

- Smart Steering is an optional feature that prevents you from falling off the track.
Auto Accelerate is also an optional feature that causes your kart to accelerate automatically. (These features can be set to on/off for each individual player.)

- There are 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Inkling Girl, and Inkling Boy. (You can also unlock Gold Mario, a variant of Metal Mario.)

- The battle mode has been completely revamped,(Because Wii U owners know that MK8U's battle mode sucked.) and may I say, it is STELLAR!!! This is the greatest Battle Mode ever! Even people who say that Battle Mode isn't their favorite will (probably) LOVE this! Battle across 1 of 8 Battle arenas in 1 of 5 different modes: Pop balloons in Balloon Battle, catch the renegades or dodge the law in Renegade Roundup, be greedy in Coin Runners, throw bombs in Bob-omb Blast, and steal and flee in Shine Thief.

And that's everything new in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe! So the question is... is MK8 worth purchasing a second time? The answer is YES! Even though I don't like when developers make a do-over of a game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is tolerable. I docked a star just because it's a port and it's $60, but other than that it's great (but if Nintendo makes a Super Smash Bros. 4 port I'm gonna lose it...).",4,6,True,0.51761049,0.159326786,528.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,1

3424,3424,17,AMAZON17,"Great Game, But Still Has Online Connection Issues",Scott,"Wii U owners might remember that the original Mario Kart 8 was released for that home console back in 2014. Three years later, and we now have Mario Kart Deluxe, a way for Nintendo to capitalize on their huge Mario Kart fan-base without dedicating too much time and money into producing the 9th iteration of the franchise this early into the Nintendo Switch's lifespan. For the most part, Deluxe is identical to the original MK8, with a couple new features included to give players a reason to pay full price again for what is essentially the same game. These include additional Battle Modes, some new tracks, characters and vehicles, all the DLC from the original Wii U version, and some refinements to online multiplayer (such as being able to change vehicles and characters without leaving the online multiplayer lobby). Of course, the main draw to getting Deluxe is being able to play Mario Kart 8 on a handheld device, which for all intents and purposes has now eliminated the reason for players to still be using Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS. However, the real question is if all these minor enhancements are enough to make MK8 players spend full price again on what is essentially the same game. The answer to that is two-fold. For people who still own a Wii U system and the original Mario Kart 8, I would not recommend getting Deluxe. However, if you're planning on selling your Wii U and upgrading to the Nintendo Switch, or you never bought a Wii U in the first place, then yes, I would recommend getting Deluxe, as it will probably be several more years before we see a true Mario Kart 9 sequel.",4,9,True,0.507070707,0.238189588,286.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,1

3428,3428,17,AMAZON17,One Of The Many Reasons Nintendo Hooked Me Back Into Video Games!,Esteban,"One of the main reasons I purchased a Nintendo Switch aside from it's hybrid functionality is it's ease of playing with others and enjoying a variety of game experiences. Mario Kart offers such awesome experience that it's perfect for a married couple. My wife and I constantly play together when we can and truly have fun! The game itself is very colorful and runs smoothly no matter how you decide to play. It's easy to pick-up and play for newcomers or people that are not into video games yet it also offers challenging modes for veterans of the series.

My only 2 gripes for the game itself is the character roster as well as unlockables or lack there of. The roster is comprised of some familiar faces but I wish there was more variety. It feels as if the koopa characters and other costume/baby variants of characters are fillers. It would have been nice to see characters from other franchises similar to super smash bros. That brings me into the second point which is the absence of unlockables. From the start all the characters and courses are available to you. The only items you are able to unlock are parts to customize your ride but I wish other forms of rewards were introduced such as more characters, courses, and an achievement list.

Despite the two drawbacks of the game this is the definitive edition and it does not take away from the overall experience of having a great time playing with other people.

3432,3432,17,AMAZON17,Great cart racer but needs tweaking,Logic,"The game is fun, looks awesome, controls are awesome, its Mario Cart! My only complaint is the frequency of items during races. You can be the best cart racer in the world and still lose!!! One minute you're in 1st place perfectly drifting making Zero mistakes. Then bam you get hit by a blue shell, then another blue shell, then maybe a couple of red shells all in a row! You go from 1st, all the way to 5th even 10th all because of things out of your control. The better you race the worst items you get from randomized weapon boxes, meanwhile people in dead last are pumbling you with Shells and other items. I wish there was a game mode where Items weren't aloud aside from custom matches. The items make this game unplayable for me, I can't be competitive in a game that screws you for playing well. Seriously.......... what were they thinking with the items?

That has been a huge part of strategy in the last mario kart games. Constantly getting a coin in first only to have a red or green shell hit you gets annoying. This allows for having a defense as well as planning ahead on when to use your items. Makes the whole game more intense and strategic. The addition of the super boost from drifting is welcome although you barely can use it as it takes a lot of turning. The battle mode is also pretty cool addition. If I knew more people with the system i think it'd be more fun but I usually still stick to just plain racing. The worse part of the port, which is terrible on Nintendo's part, is the fact that they couldn't add a few more tracks. The tracks are WAY to short to begin with. would have been nice to have an additional minute or 2 of racing because it ends too fast. So that would have been nice.

With that being said I do believe its missing something. I love the gameplay for battle mode and the races are definitely fun and its awesome that they have expanded the carts and the characters you can play with so now you have way more options of racers and carts. That being said, I think they should have 4x the levels on the game. This is a $60 game and half of the tracks are just a regurgitated version of the previous games. The nostalgia is cool and all but I believe there should be all of the retro levels and a bunch of new ones included with this title. Also there are only 4 or 5 levels that you can play in battle mode. I love this game and its been a blast but I think you can play all there is to play in one day.

But.
It's too much of a giver!
I didn't really feel like I had any progression in the game!
When you get the game all the levels, stages, and characters are unlocked already (save for the amiibo dlc). The only thing you can really unlock is kart customizations which, if you're any sort of decent at mario kart, hardly matter much besides their looks.

Graphics are incredible, and there are a bunch of little details Nintendo added in that give this game the classic Nintendo feel with a bit of modernization.
The racing mechanics are fun and easy to master with a little practice, as long as you shut off the drive-assist which is enabled by default (why?).

Definitely brought back some good nostalgia, and I'm sure I'll play it... sometimes.
I love Nintendo- die-hard fan- but man, please give us something new!
There's very little replayability to the game. After beating each stage on 50, 100, and 150cc all I wanna do is scream ""what's new?""

We played for hours until the Switch had to be charged and helped relieve the awkwardness until dinner. The only thing keeping me from absolutely loving this game is the online play is a bit laggy. Sometimes we get hit by things we can't see or connection errors come up and we all have to remake the instance for someone to reconnect. As to be expected with the first couple weeks of launch but it is a bit frustrating. Especially when the ""A communication error has occurred"" pops up and we all get disconnected from each other. A good ol' hard reboot on our Switch devices usually fixes this for a few days though, so maybe an issue with the Switch?

3449,3449,17,AMAZON17,Solid version,cwk,"I've played a lot of Mario Kart over the years and this is probably my second favorite behind the DS version. Starting with the Wii version they added gimmicks (like zero gravity and underwater) that don't really enhance the game in my view, and the courses got a little softer and less exciting (compare Bowser's Castle and Luigi's Mansion to the DS versions). The drifting mechanic is good and the countless kart / wheel combinations can make a big difference in handling. I find it's best to stick to one thing for a while. I like the coin system.

3519,3519,17,AMAZON17,"Solid game, great visuals, but they left the training wheels on",Nathan W.,"This version of Mario Cart has great visuals and I liked all the new toys and power-ups(my last version was on the Wii). I also thought gliding off jumps was a fun new addition to the series. That being said, when I play this version of the game it just doesn't feel right. In older versions you could explore the edge of the map, and if you went the wrong way you ended up paying the price. This game feels like they left the training wheels on. When you get close to the edge of the track the game takes over control of your vehicle and points you back in the right direction. As it does this even before you leave the main track at times it leaves you feeling like you're not really in control. For young kids this probably makes the game less frustrating, but for me I felt like I was bowling with the gutter guards on. I wish this was an optional setting so my young boys could use it while I was free to succeed(or fail) on my own.

New Characters such as Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Gold Mario, Inkling Boy, Inkling Girl, and King Boo. We never really used the battle mode but there are some new tracks for that mode. They have some new vehicles as well. The online mode has tournaments and you can add friends on your Switch from the people you recently played with. Regular Prix mode has a 200cc option now. I like the ability to split the Joy Con remote with a second player.

3578,3578,17,AMAZON17,"Great if you don't own Mario Kart 8 on Wii U, otherwise not worth the price.",chess & checkers,"Well, this game suffers from ""re-release syndrome"" in my opinion. There's simply not enough new stuff to make it significantly better than the Wii U version. No new tracks, a couple new characters, some improvement to visuals and a few Battle Mode innovations. The only game changer is the ability to carry two items, and by extension, double item boxes. The problem is that the game becomes even more chaotic, over-the-top chaotic in my opinion. I used to eat 0-1 Blue Shells every race in 8, rarely ever 2, but in Deluxe, be ready to consistently be on the receiving end of 2-3 Blue Shells and/or 2-3 bolts of Lightning every race. Oh, and Blue Shells now have a high trajectory, so they don't hit anyone except the leader, making them even less useful for the racer throwing it and being more annoying for the leader. The game punishes you even harder for leading, which makes the main flaw of the Mario Kart series more annoying. I'm sorry, but if the main changes in the game make it worse, you can't expect more than three stars.

So is the game bad? No, not by a longshot. It's great fun for adults, kids, parties, nostalgia and more. However, if you own the Wii U version with the DLC and are on a budget (Switch games are really expensive), you can safely skip Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. If you only have 8 on Wii U without DLC, I would still recommend just buying the DLC. However, if you don't have the Wii U version, it's a great buy.",3,3,False,0.518072727,0.050624242,265.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,39.99,0.3885281385281385,4.9,amazon,1
3579,3579,17,AMAZON17,"Do we really need blue shells, ink blots, and lightning to happen 3x in every race?",Nathaniel,"The last Mario Kart game I played was on the N64. While it had the problem of the computer getting super human speed every time it was behind, it didn't detract from the races too much.

Fast forward to 8 on the switch and the tracks remind me of F-Zero, which i think is pretty cool. I like the driving dynamics and how you have to use your brakes on 200cc to avoid hitting the walls, however, the use of items by the cpu characters gets really annoying. The blue shells, lightning, and ink blots occur almost in every lap. This becomes a nuisance after a while as the game seems to rely heavily on the use of items.

Kind of disappointed. There's seemingly little challengs, and most everything (tracks, characters, courses) is available right off the bat. You don't even have to push the 'gas pedal' anymore! You can literally set the control down and finish the race by letting it drive itself, and you may even finish in a good position. They tried too hard with the tracks to make them 'exciting'...instead some of them are just garish and chaotic and dizzying. MORE MORE MORE doesn't always mean a better game, and that's what happened here. It seems aimed at 5 year olds who always want to be a winner. If nothing else they should have put in more controls over the game parameters to make it even a little more challenging like the old Wii version which was vastly superior. If you want the numb sugar coated version, set it to that. If you want a game with a little challenge, set it to old school rules.

3622,3622,17,AMAZON17,Families Beware!!! Each Switch Console needs its own cartridge disk.,JVP,"After jumping through hoops to get 3 Nintendo Switch consoles, 1 for me and 2 for my kids, my Switch excitement balloon has officially popped. The whole focus of Switch is portable personal console. When I first heard of Switch and Mario Kart 8, I had visions of family races by the campfire while on vacation. Even though I found it expensive, I thought if it keeps the kids from fighting while on a long road trip, they can have 1 each. I tried to read as much about how local multiplayer would be, but all I dug up was speculation. Now that I have a copy of MKD8, I can't help but feel really angry because Nintendo expects us to drop an additional $60 for each console. To me, that is just being greedy.

Yes you can win the occasional online game but the feeling is shallow knowing you were mostly lucky.

User-Friendly Bliss (5/5): The best feature hands-down is the control system. Like all Ninja products, the oven does a fantastic job of simplifying the cooking process - using the oven is very intuitive and straightforward.

Taste (5/5): One of the best first bites of pizza I've had in a long time. The even heat distribution results in a consistently crispy crust with the perfect chewiness in the middle.

Effortless Cleanup (5/5): The cleanup is a breeze. Removable components and non-stick surfaces make post-cooking maintenance a quick and easy task.

Design and Durability (4.5/5): The oven has a smooth, sleek design that complements my outdoor patio. The parts and overall construction seem very solid - sustains weather conditions well.

Temperature Control (4.5/5): Precision matters, and this oven gives you the power. The temperature gauge lets me fine-tune the heat, ensuring the pizzas are cooked to perfection every single time.

Versatility (4/5): So far, I've used the oven to make pizza and roasted vegetables.

The Ninja OO101 Woodfire 8-in-1 Outdoor Oven is also incredibly easy to use. The tubs are easy to open and serve, and theyre perfectly portioned so that theres no waste. Plus, the Ninja Woodfire Technology adds authentic smoky flavor to anything you make with just 1/2 cup of pellets.

I decided this Ninja pizza oven would give me options with additional features such as dehydrating, smoking, roasting, etc. First time out I used AP flour with lower heat setting for NY style pizzaNope. The pizza was too chewy and crust was limp. Next trial I switched to King Arthur pizza flour (using their recipe for dough on the back of the bag) and set oven to Neopolitan (700) along with the wood pelletswow! This was more like authentic NY pizza. DO NOT walk a way once you put the pizza on the stone. I always set neopolitan for 3 min but it always takes TWO minutes to fully cook. Itll take you longer to make your pizza than to cook itthis is awesome for families who all want different pies (cheese only, pepperoni, veggie lovers, etc). This is truly an outdoor pizza: I was caught in the rain, twice, while making pizza and the oven operated without a hitch. Mind you, it was not an outpouring of rain, but both times more like a light rain with rain collecting on top of oven-but it still operated without issues in the rain. I just brushed the (warm) rainwater off the top of oven after every 10 min. This is my first time owning a Ninja product and I can say that I am impressed with the sturdy workmanship and the features and functionality of this oven. I am pleased that I no longer have to buy charcoal or gas and can truly grill year round now. I also tried to smoke a whole chicken in it, and while the smoke taste was awesome, the bird was a little dry because I have not yet mastered how to use the other functions of this oven.

It fits perfectly on my apartment balcony, and its sturdy build gives me confidence it'll last through many seasons. Heating up the oven is a breeze; it reaches the ideal temperature for pizzas in no time, making it super convenient for those evenings when we decide to have a spontaneous pizza night.

The temperature control is fantastic. I've been able to experiment with different types of pizzas, and each comes out with the perfect balance of crispy crust and well-cooked toppings. I've even ventured beyond pizzas, trying out BBQ ribs and artisanal bread, all with great results.

Definitely use the instruction book to cook until you really learn, I burnt my first attempt at ribs, but that was my fault. I cooked the pizza my wife and I had for lunch the next day with no problems. I dont recommend cooking a stuffed crust pizza though as the thinner crust where it is stuffed will stick to the stone. It comes with a small amount of wood pellets that should be enough for 3 uses. It says that you need to use their recommended pellets, but you should have no problem using other pellets. Pretty sure they are just trying to get repeat buying of their own pellets. I saw no discernible difference between the included pellets and the ones I had at home from our summer cookouts. If you are a handy person you could make your own stand and save a bit of money, but a normal table would suffice for normal use.

3732,3732,18,AMAZON18,Makes great pizza,green freak,"This makes excellent Neapolitan pizza and the smoke function does add a nice mild smoke flavor. I have not yet used it for other dishes as we have also have the Ninja smoker grill. We started with the grill and love it, so I started looking at the pizza oven. I got each of them on sale, but was annoyed that I had to buy both as there are a lot of overlapping functions. After using both, they each have their strengths and it is worth having both. I suspect we will use this to make smoked turkey and other baked/smoked dishes, but to have this level of quality for pizza... in my book that alone makes it worth 5 stars.

I agree with the reviewer that the process of making it ""easy"" with all the presets isn't great and would prefer a more manual approach, but others may want the presets. (I feel the same way about my Instant Pot) One thing to note is that if you want to use the smoke function for pizza, fill the pellet basket to the top and wait a little longer than the preheat time for the smoke to be in full force. I do wish that I could use this indoors without the smoke function, but the manual expressly says outdoor use only. I thought about trying it indoors for winter use, but it is tall and seems like it would look ridiculous on the counter. I ended up getting the Gemelli indoor electric pizza oven on sale and tried it out last night, it worked very well too. The Gemelli can be used outdoors as well, but I think the smoke function on the Ninja adds enough flavor that it is worth having both. I will say we really like to cook and rarely eat out... so we are more inclined to spend the money on more than one device. The Ooni or Breville electric pizza ovens are a thousand bucks, so I feel a little better about spending the same amount to get three devices that do a lot more.

For those struggling to launch your pizza into the oven, get a wood peel and search YouTube for techniques.

3733,3733,18,AMAZON18,Best Mostly Home Made Pizza Ever,Ricardo of Boulder Colorado,"I have been making home-made pizza for forever. First pizza in this oven is the best ever.

Decided to test with premade pizza dough from Whole Foods expecting disaster.
Did a custom 600F cook - top, bottom, browning just perfect appearance and taste.
Maybe a little too much oven spring. Oven or dough? To be determined.
Restaurant quality.

I do have a home made 12 inch pizza steel which I used on top of the pizza stone.

Just before the pizza, I made brownie mix brownies at 325F. Perfect.
I was expecting the top to burn or something.
Just put them in on top of the pizza stone in a 8X8 pan and 48 minutes later perfection.

Grocery had fresh whole turkey breasts for xmas - try that next weekend.

I made the pizza steel to go into my toaster oven at 450F - 450F is simply not 600F.

I am thinking a small Dutch oven for making no-knead bread.

As Alton Brown would say this is multi-tasker, not just a ""pizza oven"".

This nifty, affordable oven has solved that problem. I could not justify the cost of some of the higher end pizza ovens that require special wood or a gas connection - its just a damned pizza, for crying out loud. But the dimensions of this oven makes it usable for other things - I have roasted a fabulous whole chicken in it, on a week night, no less.

The cast iron pan included is enamel coated, making the pan worth the investment. Note that the overall high temp is fairly low for pizza, but it works beautifully with a Neapolitan crust. I am not digging the smoker feature, it adds an artificial flavor without any true smoking like you could get from a conventional smoker. So I dont use it - but you might like it.

It smokes with pellets and due to the design you don't need to use a lot of pellets to smoke your food. I can be used as an oven without smoke and it is a pizza cooker as well. I bought it to downsize from my larger smoker and it is perfect. it still smokes/cooks plenty of meat for a large meal. I've cooked beef, pork, chicken and pizza and all have come out perfect. highly recommend especially if you want a smaller smoker. You will need your own temp probe to monitor the meat so you dan't have to keep opening the door but that is a common thing to have when smoking meat. you also need some type of table to set on so it is not cooking on the ground.

My wife could smell it when she got out of the car from work and commented on how good it's going to taste. I'm anxious to try some scalloped potatoes and ham because I think a little smoke flavor would do it some good. Today was the first time using it and at first I didn't have smoke. So I called customer service number listed in the instructions and got a clear speaking easy to understand friendly representative without waiting at all.
Once they have my product registered they took care of my concerns and help me troubleshoot the problem. 10 minutes later I had more smoke going than you could ever imagine.

3802,3802,18,AMAZON18,Wonderful EASY Pizza Oven,TM,"I'm leaving my review on Amazon because, doesn't everyone look at Amazon for reviews before buying. I bought mine at the Big Box S club store (It was less and had the cover and pizza peel inc). Also note the price of these just dropped Everywhere (03-10-24)! Could there be a new model on the horizon?
This oven made fabulous pizza out of the Box (Heating it on Max for 30 min before starting Pizza setting). We got the take and bake pizza from California Pizza Kitchen for $8, Used the Neapolitan setting (with and without smoke depending on diners preference) and pulled it at 3 min or less getting a little edge char but the perfect crunchy base crust, melted but not burned cheese, and crispy edged pepperoni. We're not new to pizza ovens having had the Ooni gas oven for a few years but their volt(?) was more than I wanted to pay. This electric oven was as good as the gas version without the terror of an inferno that one has with early uses of the gas oven as well as no constant turning and babying the pizza. In fact you can't baby the pizza.. the door is closed and there's NO window!
We usually use our own dough and make our pizzas from scratch so we'll see how those are, but I'm expecting it will be great, and so much easier to do than before. Of course I'm also anxious to try the smoking feature etc and will update if there's anything to say about those.",5,0,False,0.509090909,0.157131094,258.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,349.99,0.486998556998557,4.6,amazon,0

I love the oven, the smoke feature and the pizza stone. Ive made smoked lamb, pork shoulder, brisket and so much in here, along with some amazing pizzas.

Unfortunately, the buttons stopped working on me midway through a long smoke, and I had to use my inside oven. I called Ninja and they had a replacement sent to me within 4 days without any cost to me.

It's not the crazy high end I've seen people go to for pizza ovens, but it gets the job done and is fairly versatile. It's very simple to set up and use, and while it takes a little over 20 minutes to heat up it does a great job cooking my pizzas evenly. It's also a really good size, big enough to make pizza and cook plenty of food, but not excessively large.

3806,3806,18,AMAZON18,Impressive,dw,"I'm doing a preliminary review before actually doing a cook. I need to make a trip to the store to buy some things to try out in this beast. I'll update once I cook a few things. But these are my first impressions.

This is, as I have found with my other Ninja products, well made. Looking at the controls, if you have used the Ninja air fryer, grill, etc., you will easily be able to operate this oven. The controls are very similar. The instructions are useful and straight-forward - unlike most things I have bought recently.

I read an online review (not on AZ) where someone said that assembly takes 25 minutes and requires a screwdriver. That gives me zero faith in the rest of that article, because there is NO assembly, other than unboxing everything. Beware, the pizza stone is under a flap in the top piece of Styrofoam padding. Make sure you get it out first, so you don't flip the packing over and drop it. As it says, it comes with the pizza stone, pan, rack, and a packet of all-purpose pellets, and a use/recipe book.
- First gripe - the Woodfire Grill came with robust pellets as well.
- Second gripe - this thing is a pizza oven with a pizza stone - really, you don't get a pizza peel with it, purchased separately, and kinda expensive?
- Third gripe - the stand is the same as the one for the Woodfire grill - and wow, it's really expensive. I have a nice cart I have put it on.

I see questions like whether it can be used indoors (folks keep asking this for the Woodfire grill as well). Yeah, you could, but you have to restrict what you do with it. None of the high-temp stuff and smoking. You might as well just buy a countertop oven for less cost. It is made for use outside.

The beauty of it is the high cooking temps it will reach, much higher than my regular oven - it does take a while to preheat to that level, it says 25 minutes. But you can do some serious broiling - like steaks - at those temps. That is going to be the first thing I try it with. It also allows you to do custom/specialty broiling, a 2-level process with a high-temp start and a lower-temp finish. That will be my second cook, using that for a whole chicken.

I love smoke flavor. I have been very pleased with my Woodfire grill, and I make smoked wings almost every week. I don't know that I will use this oven for things like that, but if I didn't have the grill, I might. But whatever I cook in it I will probably add some smoke. I know they push their (very expensive) pellets, but folks online say you can use other pellets. You could try others, just keep an eye on it - these are used for smoke generation only, not heat generation like a pellet grill, so your mileage may vary. At least it only takes a half cup of pellets per session.

And it's a pizza oven! There are several pizza settings, and I am looking forward to trying them. It is limited to 12 inch. The pizza stone fits nicely under the unit when not being used.

So my first impression is that it seems to be extremely versatile, and I look forward to doing a lot of cooking with it. I will probably replace my gas fired pizza oven since this will do what it does plus all the other baking and broiling functions, and is easier to use... and there is only so much room on my deck.",5,19,False,0.470312975,0.078678328,616.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,349.99,0.486998556998557,4.6,amazon,1

3814,3814,18,AMAZON18,Great for pizza!,J,"Weve been looking for a woodfire pizza oven so when I saw this oven from Ninja I immediately added it to my cart. Weve been a fan of Ninja products for a while because of their build quality and durability. This outdoor oven is no exception. Its heavy and feels like a premium product. Unboxing is super simple. Just lift the top of the box off. There are a few foam pieces and then you get to the oven. Ours arrived with a small dent on the side which must have happened at the factory since the packaging was intact with no damage. At this price point Id normally dock a star for this but since it in no way affected the functionality Im leaving it as five stars.

The instruction manual is very straightforward and clearly shows how to use the oven. Got it fired up and made pizza last night. My advice is to start on a lower temperature to see how quickly it cooks. I used the recommended setting and time for a Neapolitan crust and it burned. Tried again at a lower temp and it cooked perfectly. Overall really impressed with how these turned out.

We havent tried the wood pellets yet but are looking forward to using this as a smoker when we dont want to fire up our big one.

You only get one smoked pizza per dose of wood chips and only 3 doses of chips come with unit (so plan on lots of wood chips, buy in bulk), no utensils come with it, so you'll need high heat pot holders or gloves, and a real big spatula, all accessories are available on line though and lots of flour on a cutting board works to slide it in too!",5,0,False,0.632592593,0.198209877,209.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,349.99,0.486998556998557,4.6,amazon,0
3816,3816,18,AMAZON18,Several things your indoor oven can't do,Boaz S.,"I did not want to come into this review lightly - this is a unique item that deserves my honest insight.
Ninja products are very popular in my community so I knew I have to give it a chance.

This is a robust and heavy device, I placed it on a large metal surface although I found it does not heat the surface below it too much.
I found the killer apps to be:
- Wood smoke flavor on both very high and very low heat.
- High temperatures for Neapolitan and ""max roast""
- Very successful low-and-slow
I watched a couple of examples on youtube and tried to follow them - got similar results for Pizza and Salmon, my family was very pleased with both. Followed it up with a brisket with my friend that came out amazing and smokey. The oven did not disappoint in real life compared to the photos and videos.

Note that the high temp cooking requires a long wait time to heat up so plan accordingly.
A pizza peel is something you need to buy separately and is completely essential to use with the pizza stone.

If you have an outdoor kitchen and want to add this unique device it can be a very good fit and may make more sense than a large ""analog"" pizza oven. You are getting a great showcase of several things your indoor oven can't do.",5,5,False,0.579197802,0.32582967,227.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,349.99,0.486998556998557,4.6,amazon,1

After you decide where you want to keep it outside and buy a good cover you can finally get down to cooking. We started with pizza and decided to purchase a pizza peel which sped up production. Getting the ninja going took a few trail and errors only because we didnt read the instructions carefully. There are a couple of steps you have to follow to get it going into its pre heat mode. We had thought it was going for about ten min before we realized we had to hit the start button again. Once the oven is preheated you insert your pizza and have to set a timer to get it to start cooking. We werent sure how long a pizza would take so we started low at about 3 min. This was perfect! Some went faster for thinner crusts, and were talking 2 min and 30 seconds on some. In total we cooked all these pizzas in about ten min. My advice with pizza is have them all made and ready to go if youre going scratch mode.

3818,3818,18,AMAZON18,DOES IT ALL!,Dale,"I have had the Ninja Woodfire outdoor grill for a year (also highly recommend) and while there are some overlapping features between these two, this oven really adds a lot to my outdoor arsenal.

One of the big reasons I ordered this is for pizza. Its awesome for parties and large dinners. After a ~25 minute pre-heat, you can crank out one after another in just 4-5 minutes each. There are pre-sets for different types of crust. I went with the thin setting and did my usual pizza recipeWow, this really makes the same old pizza MUCH better. The crust was much more airy and I love browning of the cheese. And it was amazing how easy it was to get that result on the first use at the pre-set time and temp.

And theres so much more it can do. The great thing about these Woodfire products is that they can impart a ton of smoke flavor with just a handful of pellets. Ive done jerky, pulled pork and a brisket flat. All taste and look like they came out of a Traeger! Look at that bark!!! And so easy too.

I only wish this had a viewing window in the door. Otherwise its the perfect product. Compact enough to be somewhat mobile (although heavy) and great for a small patio or balcony. But still big enough to handle 12 pies, brisket flats, and decent sized birds. Ninja is really changing the game with these.

Pro tip: Ive been using non-Ninja pellets in this and my Woodfire grill with no issues. The off brand pellets really open up the flavor options and saves money too. Just buy quality ones designed for food, NOT FUEL!

This oven comes with strapping around the box. To open the box properly, cut the straps and then remove them from the box (mine had some tape as well over the straps) and slide the box up. Be sure and remove the pizza stone as it sits at the top of the package. The oven is fairly heavy, but one person should be able to handle it. Be sure and remove all packaging, including inside the oven as the rack is in there as well as some moisture packets. I heated mine to 700 degrees (Max Roast) and after it warmed up (20 minutes) I let it stay on for another 20 minutes to burn out any chemical smell (there was one). My first use was actually for a steak, and I was impressed with my first experience of cooking at 700 degrees.

Complaints:

- The oven does not come with a stand, and the stand they sell as an accessory is way over-priced so I would suggest buying something else.

- It doesn't come with a pizza peel. We already had one, but if you don't, you will need to get one.

- No cover is included (they sell one for around $30).

The smoke flavor I think is a little over powering on most pizzas, but nice to have for the occasional use. Others will feel different. The size plus time it takes to cook I think will make this a little tougher to use for more than 1 or 2 people at a time. The pizzas you can make I'd put on par size with national chain medium sized pizza. They do cook pretty quick, 4 - 8 minutes depending on the type and options, but I think that also means you either need good planning, coordination, and cooperation, or small parties when using this appliance. When cooking for a family or more than a couple people at a time, you might be better off just buying a large pizza stone or two, and using the oven in your kitchen. Most of what I find makes the pizza so good out of the ninja comes down to the pizza stone.

My experience with this oven has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I want to warn others about the frustrations I have encountered.

First and foremost, the oven's performance is abysmal. It takes forever to preheat, and even then, it fails to reach the desired temperature accurately. I've had numerous instances where my food either comes out undercooked or burnt to a crisp. It's incredibly frustrating to invest in an oven that can't even perform its basic function properly.

Furthermore, the oven's build quality is extremely poor. The control knobs are flimsy and feel like they could break off with the slightest touch. The oven door doesn't close properly, resulting in heat escaping and uneven cooking.

3903,3903,19,AMAZON19,Best cooler I own,HulkHuggett,"I own several coolers, including Yeti Tundra. I have 2 different sizes of this igloo. I live in Central Texas where it gets mega hot! I have brought all my coolers with me to job sites every day and I leave them in my truck. The igloos last the longest and blow the yeti away! I came back for a 3rd igloo, but I'm looking for a different color than is currently offered (only down side). I LOVE the handle. It makes for easy in and out of whatever, and I can carry it with one hand. I don't usually latch the latches and it works amazing. Best cooler on the market for hot summers.

Just for reference: the Yeti will hold ice for most of a work day, inside my truck, with ice turned to cool water by the end of day. The igloos will last 2 days (it will be ice and water). No cooler will hold ice for 5 days inside of a hot truck in central Texas. I was able to get a 3rd day with my bigger igloo but it wasn't inside my truck, it was in the bed, but getting hammered by the sun. I truly believe the design of this cooler to be the best out there. I have used almost every big brand you can think of.

I have returned both coolers and received refund for original cooler, but that was under warranty. Every single person I talked to at Igloo, assured me they would make this right! As of this date, they have not! I had to spend money with their carrier as they would not ship it back without repackaging the damaged product, which their shipper had damaged! I do not ask for the $100 in gas and time for two days travel because they sent damaged product twice, but did expect them refund the repackaged gift fee that they were making right but they have not and are ignoring any contact!

Igloo coolers, by far, has the worst customer service on the planet. The products I received were either inferior or damaged. Dont seem to care that returning each time is a day trip for me, a ton of gas and time as I am a homesteader living very outlying. These coolers are my refrigerator system for now so I have to be able to rely on them. Have also explained this and just say return again. And their solution is well give you 20% off your NEXT one!

I have the sportsman 55 quart cooler by Igloo and that is hands down the best cooler I've ever had my hands on hands down, ice will last a week. I trusted that the Igloo IMX 24 would carry that same quality, hence the price and the name. I've had the cooler for about 3 to 4 months and used it weekly, I'm actually upset/disappointed with the performance of the IMX 24, ice will only last a day at best in the garage or in a house or shade at a gathering. I even checked to make sure it was insulated, and it was so my guess is the type of insulation used in it is cheap quality.

3969,3969,20,AMAZON20,Long but honest review,Ysf,"After meticulous research and deliberation, I finally decided to invest in the Dyson Animal 3 Upright Vacuum. I'll be honest, the mixed reviews had me hesitant, but after weighing the options, I took the plunge, and boy, am I glad I did.

Let's address the elephant in the room: thick carpets. Numerous reviews warned against its efficacy on plush carpets, but I'm thrilled to report that I've encountered zero issues with my shaggy, thick rugs. The Dyson Animal 3 glides effortlessly, thanks to its versatile carpet settings. Simply adjust the settings and let it do its magic.

One of my past gripes with Dyson vacuums was their ball mechanism, which tended to veer off-course. However, the Animal 3's swivel mechanism strikes the perfect balance between flexibility and stability. It maintains a straight trajectory while still offering easy maneuverability around obstacles.

Now, onto the pros. The suction power is unparalleled, effortlessly tackling dirt, pet hair, and debris with ease. The rotating brush does an impeccable job of clearing hair, sparing me the hassle of manually detangling ita game-changer for pet owners like myself. And let's not forget the stair tool, a seemingly small accessory that has revolutionized my staircase cleaning routine. No more awkward lifting or strained backsthis little tool does wonders.

However, it's not without its flaws. The vacuum's weight may be a concern for some, although it's comparable to other models in its class. Additionally, I share the sentiment of other reviewers regarding the durability of certain plastic components. Given the vacuum's hefty price tag, I expected sturdier materials. Plus, there's a minor issue with the hose wand occasionally sticking during retraction, but it's a minor inconvenience.

In conclusion, despite my initial skepticism, the Dyson Animal 3 has exceeded my expectations. Its powerful suction, efficient cleaning capabilities, and thoughtful design make it a worthy investment for any household. While it's not without its quirks, the positives far outweigh the negatives. If you're on the fence like I was, take the plungeyou won't regret it.",5,31,True,0.514129073,0.105748747,330.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,399.0,0.450384024577573,4.4,amazon,1

3971,3971,20,AMAZON20,We have a hairy dog and this vacuum works like a champ!,Irene Shepard,"Love this vacuum! We have a hairy dog! Anyone with a hairy dog knows how challenging it is to keep rugs and cars 'hair free'. After the first use, I had vacuumed enough hair to make a 2nd dog and we only have carpet in the bedroom, and a big rug in the living room and dining room... we have a Roomba for everyday use (which is great on the wood floors - and it does go over the 3 rugs as well), but, I was shocked at how much hair this vacuum picked up on 3 rugs - enough to make my fur baby a ""buddy'!!! The vacuum is very agile and moves around furniture and dog beds easily..... I actually bought this vacuum to use in my Tahoe! The only 2 'cons' are: 1) the vacuum is rather heavy to lift...but being the optimist I am, I figure I am building arm muscle and 2) it is a bit loud (for those with sensitive ears turn up the music or put in ear plugs).....in my world this is not relevant but for many people they may want to be aware of this. For my Tahoe, I fold down the back seats, set the vacuum up inside the Tahoe and because the handle of the vacuum goes perpendicular down, and the agility of the vacuum, I was able to vacuum the back quite easily and it worked like a champ! It was a bit challenging to get under the seats and in the corners (where dog hair loves to go), but the attachments worked well enough. I pulled out the floor liners and vacuumed them on the ground. There was not 1 dog hair left on the floor liners. With patience and little bit of ""elbow grease"" I got rid of about 95% of the hair in my Tahoe, which again, anyone with a hairy dog, knows this actually a good %. I have not yet tried the attachment that can actually be used on the Dog but based on how well the vacuum performed in getting my Tahoe ""dog hair clean"", I am thinking it will most likely work like a champ (provided I can get him near the vacuum).",5,16,True,0.417211329,0.117337282,372.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,399.0,0.450384024577573,4.4,amazon,1

3973,3973,20,AMAZON20,Amazing Vacuum,Amanda Hartnett,"I previously owned a Dyson Yellow Multi-Floor 2 vacuum that finally had an issue with the head after 5 years of heavy use. I decided to switch to this vacuum since having 3 dogs in the house means sucking up a TON of hair, and didn't want to run into the same issues with the head.

I read a lot of reviews about how to suction makes it hard to maneuver easily - Yes and No. Compared to the Multi-Floor 2, it definitely doesn't glide as well, BUT! There are 3 levels of suction that you can set it to. I have tile in the Kitchen and Dining Room, so I use the hard-surface (strongest suction) setting here. I don't have any issues. I have glue-down flooring in the main living space, and I do have to step down the suction to low-pile carpet in there. For some reason, with the super strong suction, it makes it a little harder to vacuum that floor type with the hard-surface setting. For low-pile carpets, I set it to high-pile (lowest setting).

Overall, you just have to get used to the settings and what works for your flooring type. I appreciate that the suction is so good. I mean, it captures EVERYTHING. And the fact that it comes with so many attachments is great. I use the stair cleaner for a lot of different uses (under the sofa, under the cabinet toe-kicks, under beds, etc.)

I also like the longer cord on this one. I can get almost all the way around my 1,200Ssf house if I plug it in the living room.

If I had to give it some cons vs. the Multi-Floor 2, I would say:
-The head is a little taller on this one. I can't quite fit it under my Kitchen cabinet toe-kicks. I do need an attachment to get crumbs under there.
-I take the head off a lot to travel with (I also clean an Air BnB on the weekends) and the little clip underneath that secures it in place doesn't always attach, sometimes you have to fiddle with it by hand

Overall, would highly recommend if you have lots of pets, or lots of pet hair!",5,22,True,0.415044803,0.100358423,363.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,399.0,0.450384024577573,4.4,amazon,1

3988,3988,20,AMAZON20,You can never go wrong with a Dyson Ball that plugs in!,Jaymi,"I have had a Dyson since the beginning before they were the known as must have the vacuums. I have pets and own a Dyson cordless Pet except quickly found out unless if you live in a house with no carpet, only have 500 square feet to clean, its going to take you 2 days since youll need to stop, plug-in and recharge the lithium battery as well youll have to dump out the very small canister 2-3 times. I got tired of that real quick and ordered the new Dyson Pet Ball. I needed something that I could do all my vacuuming at once, I love the fact that all the attachments came with it and they attach directly to the vacuum, a 15-20ft strong cord, and has the ability to change the lentgth of the carpet. First time vacuuming the living room with it I had a full container, as a pet owner with a large dog, two cats, and a toddler it has been nice owning both but understand that isnt super realistic for most people. The cordless pet is great for hardwood floors and tile, stairs and baseboards, the car, and its super easy to pull out quickly for surface cleaning but The traditional Dyson Animal Ball is what you need when you really need to deep clean and vacuum everything and not have to worry about the battery dying. Dysons are not cheap and understand that most people cant afford to own both so of I had to choose one over another I would spend my money on the tradition Dyson Animal Ball that plugs in, you get everything that the cordless provides you except it is a little more bulky to lug around and makes stairs , and baseboards a pain but you get double the suction power all the time.

Biggest complaint was shipping and not understanding why it it took 4 weeks for me to get it. I had purchased it from Amazon and not a third party because I specifically asked they ship it in an additional Amazon box since they are now just shipping larger products in their boxes and I didnt want a brand new Dyson vacuum hanging out on my porch until I got home from work. Not sure if that was the reason that slowed my shipping down but instead of getting it in a week or two it took a month before it even left the Amazon warehouse.

Also standing it up, without it falling over when you walk away, works better. I think the cord might even be a bit longer. It's better in every way.

Suction power is super strong, but I read several reviews on here saying it was too strong, so strong that they could barely push it on carpet. One reviewer said they even go to the gym and found it too difficult to push this thing around due to it's extreme suction. I almost didn't buy this due to those reviews! Silly. It's fine.

One pitfall is it is really heavy to push around. I saw other reviews about the weight and they arent lying. It definitely takes some strength.

However, I originally changed the setting on the front to the lowest which i think is for hardwood, and i couldnt move it on my carpet. I guess i thought it was for matted down entangled carpet.

I seriously dont know why we waited so long to get one! This machine is absolutely amazing!! It cleaned up our furry house in no time, the suction is amazing (there wasnt hardly any dust beneath our area rug) and the control is so easy (I honestly dont know why Ive seen so many reviews that say that its too heavy and hard to control). The weight is substantial, but to me it feels like its perfect for the amount of power coming from this baby.

I love the super long cord and the wand. Oh! And, the reusable filter actually is a reusable filter! (My last vacuum had a reusable filter, but it was a nightmare to deal with). I was also super surprised at how quiet it is.

This was after using my Sharks several times a week. I've been using the Dyson for about 2 months now and the brush roll is 100% clear, not a single hair on it.

4038,4038,20,AMAZON20,Great device. Cleans amazing. Great upgrade,Amy,We upgraded to this vacuum after our 16 y/o Dyson D17 kicked the bucket. After watching many review videos and reading we decided that going with something else when our old Dyson lasted 16 years was just not gonna happen. The only negative comments about this I could find was the somewhat difficulty level of pushing. In all honestly if you dont have some resistance when operating then its probably not cleaning like it should be. This vacuum is not too difficult to push or pull and if it is you might need to address some other issues other than your vacuum. As far as the performance of this machine it by far exceeded my expectations. I didnt realize how much stuff our old unit wasnt picking up until using this.

CONS:

1) The hose is very difficult to use. It is quite long and has a lot of tug when you try to use it in low corners.

2) The attachments could have been engineered to be more securely placed on the vacuum. They can easily fall off.

I'm very happy overall, but that said: I've never had a vacuum that I might say is possibly too good at its job before, but I would say that about this one. The suction on this machine is so intense that it sticks the machine down and makes it difficult to push around my medium pile carpet at times, even when the slider is on its lightest shag setting. I cannot use it on my small area rugs because it sucks up the edges even with the brush off and on the lightest setting, which my prior model did not do. I'd definitely rather have it do too good a job than an insufficient one, so I personally don't see this as a big downside. But I don't think I could recommend that an elderly or otherly-abled to use this, and I don't think you can give your small children the vacuuming chore with it either.

As with most things, you can definitely notice a decrease in quality over 1.5 decades ago.

Pros
- Suction power - still that amazing Dyson suckage.
- No tangle technology - it works! I have two long hair dogs that put this to the test.

Cons
- It's infuriating to have to turn the brush bar EVERY SINGLE TIME you power the vacuum on and only after the power is on. As someone with primarily hard flooring, this would have been a dealbreaker if I had known. So dumb.
- Bin size - the bin is much smaller that my previous model. As a result, I almost always have to touch it to empty. Also, it means more emptying which means more rage about the damn brush bar.
- Hose & attachment - I prefer the older connection style. Despite being 50' the hose is difficult to pull to that length.
- Quality - the thickness of the plastic (bin, hose hanger, etc) overall seems flimsier.

4099,4099,20,AMAZON20,Pros and Cons,Amazon Customer,"Dyson Ball 3 animal replaced a hoover that was wearing out.
PRO 1: It has a lot more suction and the roller does a great job of pulling out the fur. I'm satisfied with how much it pulls up. One thing to remember is that ANY vacuum will not get it all up so if you go back over it with another, you'll still pull out more. That doesn't mean the second vac is any better than the first. So when I see those comparisons, I'm not impressed. What I'm impressed with is that when I run a fur catching brush over the floor, there is hardly any fur left after vacuuming (we have lots of fur here).
PRO 2: The cord is long enough to plug in one place and get the whole house. My house isn't huge but I couldn't do it with the Hoover.

CON 1: The wand. Seriously it's not usable. It takes a lot of force to pull against the poll and hose, and it just doesn't want to go where you want it to. The marketing shows someone doing their curtains. No. The suction is too great for that, and good luck aligning the pole to the curtain. On my Hoover, I would pull the hose out and do the baseboards. Can't do that with this one. (And it's annoying that every time I stand the vac up straight, my sleeve gets sucked in at the top when suction changes to the roller to the wand)

CON2: Edging. It doesn't get close to the walls. So, every couple of weeks, I get down on the floor and use my hand to gather the dirt and fur at the base boards.

Would I buy it again? I don't know. I love how it picks up fur, but I hate that I have to go back. And I hate that the dust flies all over the place when I empty the collection bin. I get that it's nice to see what you pick up, but I think I prefer a bag vac.",4,5,False,0.562295752,0.126429739,341.0,,en,amazon,1,1,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,399.0,0.450384024577573,4.4,amazon,1

4102,4102,20,AMAZON20,"Heavy, Awkward, Hose too short, Front falls off, lots of heat",Laura,"I think my title sums it up. This does have amazing sucking power and the way it doesnt tangle is fabulous as we have a high shed breed with medium hair and another with long but thats about all I can say thats good.

The vacuum itself is heavy. The front constantly falls off. When I tried to return it Amazon just kept sending me to a Dyson repair troubleshoot parts page but Dyson doesnt have a separate replacement front so I was stuck with no way to return it.

This vacuum also puts out a lot of heat from the bottom. If you dont have AC or have poor AC and vacuum with this machine, it is going to put out a lot of heat into your room. We had to turn it off and turn on the fans.

The hose is too short as well so the awkwardly heavy vacuum is on top of your toes practically when you try to use the hose. Plus, the hose doesnt get into tight spaces without bending it at such a severe angle of the soft part right up against the hard part that its sure to tear or wear too fast if I do that.

This purchase was a huge regret. There are other models and brands that have the same no tangle pet brushes without parts falling off, that weigh less, that are less awkward to push around and with decent hose lengths.

On occasion it won't pick stuff off the hard floor- like a cheerio - no matter what level I adjust the vacuum head to. The pet brush tool and upholstery tools work well.
Now for the big cons:
The hose/wand is almost unusable because the suction is so great it sucks the hose back to the unit and if you pull it too far away it'll tip over. The pictures of the lady with the hose all stretched out are most definitely not with the vacuum running. As others have noted, it is heavy and can give you a workout on higher pile carpets.
The upholstery tool is super loud.
This will eat my area rugs any chance it gets. Without the brush on the cleaning isn't adequate but unless I'm quick and only run the vacuum in one direction, my rug gets sucked up and stops the brush.

But

The Dyson engineers went out of their way to make the thing hard to use. Unlike the Shark, which almost has fighter aircraft ""hands on stick and throttle"" controls, Dyson put the selector down on the rotor, requiring extra physical effort.

And

The rotor head frequently comes off. I mean, it completely disconnects from the upright, forcing frustrating, time-consuming, aggravating interruptions.

I'm not sure why people are complaining about maneuverability because it's easy enough for me. Perhaps the height of the carpet pile has something to do with it. When it comes to using the attachments I can't imagine a worse design. Absolutely everything about using the attachments suck. You will want to vacuum the entire house and then come back with any attachments you want to use. Also, there's usually a solid curved piece where the hose attaches to the nozzle. This is straight where it attaches to the nozzle so anytime you are using the attachments you run the risk of binding the hose. I can't help but to think the added stress will reduce the life of the hose. The hose itself seems to be good quality, however, it's very stiff and doesn't stay stretched out when you are trying to use the attachments. The build quality is also a concern. Every piece and part of this vacuum screams cheap, fragile, and cost cutting. Many things are just clicked together by the tiniest plastic tabs and even the cord holders are paper thin though they seem pretty flexible which may keep them from breaking. The turbo brush and pet groomer are more novelty then usable.

If all you want to do is vacuum the carpet this has a lot of pickup power and will work great. I bought the ""extra"" version and for $100 ""extra"" dollars I got the turbo brush and the pet groomer which, as I previously stated, are rather gimmicky.

4171,4171,20,AMAZON20,Great vacuum suction; horrible wand & accessory tools,Fen,"TL/DR: Send it back immediately if you don't like it after the first 2-4 uses; it doesn't get better.

In a nutshell: Vacuum suction is absolutely fantastic but that's where the positives reviews end on my part. Power cord constantly gets wrapped around the teeny back wheels. The stair tool barely makes contact to begin with, but if the surface isn't perfectly flat, it won't suck up anything at all (e.g., trying to clean the filter grate of a room air purifier). The tool with a brush feature is so-so; the bristles don't get into crevices very well. Wand feels cheap quality; doesn't reach as far as the one on my previous machine, & the tools are a pain to snap on & off. Not to mention that if you think you can keep tools from your old Dyson to use on your new one; you can't. Size is different. Machine can't get itself over a 1/8"" - 1/4"" inch door mat; I have to pick it up.

This is my first new vacuum in over 15-18yrs. I previously had a Dyson DC14 & loved that machine but it hadn't been working as well as it use to for quite some time so I opted for the new Dyson Animal 3 Extra. I realize designs change over the years but this new machine was too expensive to not be anywhere near the quality of my DC14. I can't figure out how to write a review on the actual Dyson.com website -- I assume a customer has to be invited to review their products -- so I'm writing my ""buyer beware"" here.

Be sure to be diligent about the cutoff date for a return & keep your boxes until that date has past! Completely my fault for not looking my return by date up sooner. I kept thinking/hoping I could learn to live with this vacuum. I was exactly a week out of date when I contacted customer service. Brought up all my issues with this machine but the only response I got was that they couldn't do anything b/c I was out of date to start a return. Again, my fault; just an FYI if anyone else tries this machine & is on the fence about whether to keep it. Customer service is polite but obviously not interested to do anything to even attempt to help. My take is that they don't legally have to since I was outside the return window & aren't overly concerned with customer retention. However, as a Dyson customer for the last 15-18+ yrs, the response was disappointing & this will be my last Dyson purchase. I'm extremely sorry now that I didn't save myself more than half the cost & try the Shark vacuum instead.",2,7,False,0.389089878,0.056006494,458.0,,en,amazon,1,1,2,2,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,399.0,0.450384024577573,4.4,amazon,1
4172,4172,20,AMAZON20,Nice suction upgrade from original model but Unbelievable frustrating to actually Use!,Camper Van Beethoven,"Changed from 5 star to 2 star.
Number one issue, the origami process to get the hose back into its cradle is so frustrating I want to toss this in the bin every time I use it!!!!! JHC, put so alignment arrows on it fercrisakes! Never know which way to align the hose to get it back into the cradle and should have to memorize how to use a vacuum!!!

Also, simply can't tolerate the inability to stand this thing up on its own. You think it's clicked up into upright position but it's not, it immediately falls back over. Getting tired of this 'feature'.

Also snap on brush head falls off more than it should. So far its fallen off 4 times in the month I've had it. Not running into things with it, simply using it as normal. PIA.

Where the cord mounts to the machine is too low so you're constantly tripping over it! The old one's cord connection was up high and worked perfectly.
So tired of fighting the freaking hose, every time I use it, it's such a frustrating chore. Non intuitive to slide it back into place, they need 2 arrows so you can line them up to put it all back together. Suction pulls on the hose so you're constantly fighting it.

Positives:
First time using I found the dirt canister was MUCH more full than original. LOTS more dog hair in the bin.
Head is lower and more compact, fits under beds/chairs easier.
Quieter than original.
Slightly lighter than original.
Tool use takes getting used to but everything works.

Negatives:
Doesn't pick up large debris well
Slightly harder to push on berber carpet but it cleans it and lifts the pile very well.
The stand up locking mechanism could be better, it releases too easily (or is it too hard to engage?) causing the vac to fall over backwards.
The registration system promises free tools if you register but they neglect to tell you it's ONLY when bought from Dyson website. They tell you this AFTER they've collected all of your personal registration info.
Tool caddy placement isn't intuitive and instructions don't convey this info well.

4174,4174,20,AMAZON20,Not your father's Dyson,CCSWebWeaver,"I have owned Dyson DC17 since 2007. The machine has good build quality, and will pick up dirt other vacuums leave behind. Sadly, after 15 years of regular use, it has begun showing its age. Based on my awesome experience with the DC17, I decided to replace it with another Dyson.

After some research, the ""dyson ball animal 3 extra"" seemed to be the current successor to the DC17.

I ordered the machine, and it arrived as scheduled.

My experience with the dyson ball animal 3 extra:

Unboxing was a pain. Parts were in individual boxes which were arranged in a larger box like a tetris puzzle. The larger outer box was glued together 'askew', and the internal boxes were tightly held in place.

Assembly was only minorly irritating; and the instructions include pictures (yes pictures) in two languages.
Parts are thin, cheaply made, and snap together.

First impressions:
Pros:
The dyson ball animal 3 extra includes some decent attachments, and swapping them out is rather straight-forward.
The unit has a decent length cord.
Decent suction power.

Cons:
The build quality of the parts is poor; durability will likely be an issue.
The buttons for power and head motor feel cheap and mushy.
Small brush head. I have included a picture of the brush heads side by side.
Poor cleaning.
Prone to falling over unless extra effort is exercised when maneuvering the rear 'rollers' under the base.

I vacuumed my living room carpet with the new dyson. Cornering is a bit 'weird', and the whole machine feels like it wants to twist. After running for a few minutes, I checked the bin and it was empty. I then adjusted the brush head height, and tried again. Still nothing. A third adjustment had the v=vacuum head sucking hard on the carpet, and only minimal contents made it into the bin.
I pulled out old faithful DC17, went over the same area one time, and the bin had noticeable content. I have included a picture of the bins of both machines side by side.

After watching my demo, my wife absolutely refused to even touch the new vacuum.

Bottom line: cheap parts, poor build quality, horrible design, and next-to-none cleaning capability, combined with small head and small bin - this is a hard pass for me.

4175,4175,20,AMAZON20,Dont Buy This Vaccuum if You Use the Hose. Its that bad.,alldenmik,"Edit: Every time I use this thing, Im just newly shocked at how badly the hose is designed. Its truly unusable, folks. Notice the YouTube videos never show someone using the hose? Thats because they cant. Dont buy this vacuum if you use the hose. Its inflexible, mounted in a way that doesnt make sense, the vacuum cant stand up while you use it, the hose attachment is 4 feet long, jams constantly and doesnt break down, because that would make clearing it out easier, and they clearly put thought into making it as useless as they could. Keep a straightened out wire coat hanger for clearing it out. Thats all. I just came to vent that.

It has great suction- picks up pet hair and small to medium debris.
It is an absolute workout to get it to move any direction but straight back and forth- the ball gimmick isnt as helpful as you would think, in terms of mobility. It tilts back and forth in an irrelevant way. It does not easily move around the floor.
The worst part about it is the hose/tool feature. The cord wrapper is on top of the hose, and the handle mechanism mounts to the unit by being inserted in the hose and clipped to the unit. So you have to unpack the whole cord and remove the handle mechanism from the hose- the vacuum isnt self-supporting and will fall over 5 times during this process- plug in the tool you want to use, drag the whole thing up to what youre cleaning- because the hose is also stiff and bulky and doesnt stretch or flex- clean, fighting the hose every step of the way, then repeat all this to put the unit away. If you get this thing out of the closet once a week, vacuum your whole house and consider the job done, I guess this is doable.
If you clean up sofas and chairs occasionally without meaning to do the floor, or want to stand the unit at the foot of the stairs and do the stairs with just the hose, like it shows on the box, not dragging the unit along with you like youll actually have to do, its a deal-breaker.
If I could figure out how to get everything back in the shipping box, Id return it.

First off, the opening from the rollers to the dirt canister is like half an inch wide, so every time you use it, you have to disassemble it to unclog the hole there.

I have two toddlers and need to use the vacuum frequently, so having to take it apart just adds to the list of things I have to do and makes the chore take twice as long.
The red, tough fibers around the rollers that sweep the dirt and hair up fell off so that made it pointless to even use anymore after that. Had to painstakingly try and glue them back on.

Even on the lowest setting (bare floor) it would suck up my thin rugs and not vacuum them. My animal ball 2 vacuums them just fine.
Also, the head is very small on this and is not sturdy. I'm rough on my vacuum, I slam it into chairs/baseboards, and this thing looks and sounds like it will break quickly.
On top of the small size of the head, it doesn't swivel, hard to push, it cleaned stairs well, but the extension tube and even the power cord feels cheaper. It's just not a Dyson.

4221,4221,20,AMAZON20,This vacuum really,Elle,"Ive never had to ice my shoulder after vacuuming until today, after pushing this tank on its lumbering maiden voyage. I purchased locally due to timing, but it was more expensive than here, so by all means, purchase from Amazon if you choose to roll the dice. Ive had two other Dysons. The first was well made and purchased years ago. The second one, which was also a Pet ball style, was inferior in quality but still performed well. That trend continues with this one, Im afraid except it does not operate with the ease of its two predecessors. While the assembly appears simplistic. Ive got to believe something is wrong with the connection of the brush head to vacuum, making it incredibly difficult to push. Also it has fallen off three times in 15 minutes, despite attaching as directed and hearing the click at least the first two times. It is extremely loud. (Again, Ive owned two other Dysons and never felt the need for ear plugs.)

4226,4226,20,AMAZON20,Don't get it. Period.,Nath,"Poor design all around. I've had to disassemble the plastic channel that directs the dirt from the roller to the bin a million times. This channel has tight twists and turns, I mean 90 degrees twists, so it gets clogged up ALL THE TIME. You're gonna need time and tools to keep this vacuum functional for more than a day at a time.
Also, the hose feature is entirely useless. It's so stiff and the vac is so unstable that the vac topples over at the slightest pull of the hose. The hose 'wants' to stay compressed, so you have to keep yanking it to extend it at all....which, of course, knocks the vac over every time. What a mess! This machine was obviously designed on a CadCam computer in a lab by engineers who never actually vacuumed a house in their entire lives.
Yes, it has power. But you get even more power from a cheap home depot vac at a a FIFTH the price and it won't clog up on you like this feature-bloated fiasco.
Also, god forbid you have stairs!

4230,4230,20,AMAZON20,It broke the first time I used it and burned my foot.,raincitykitty,"I purchased this item from a big box store and not Amazon. I'm leaving a review here because I hope others will see it. My old Animal Complete died this morning after 13 years of use. I decided to replace it with this one. What a major mistake.

As others have mentioned, it's hard to get the vacuum head to stay attached. It fell off twice after I heard it click into place. The handle and tools are considerably more flimsy than they were on my old Dyson and the vacuum head is smaller. The dirt cup seems smaller, too.

After using it for about 5 minutes, I smelled burning plastic. When I took a step forward to take a look at it, I stepped on a chunk of molten blue plastic on my carpet. The red brush strip had come off the roller (ripped off somehow, because blue strips from the roller were present as well) and wrapped around the axle of the vacuum head rendering it completely frozen and unable to rotate.

The only positive thing that I can say about it is that for the few minutes it did work without spewing molten plastic, it worked really well for both dirt and pet hair even on places I thought were already clean.

I returned it. Even if the issue with the roller brushes was a defect (and I haven't seen anyone else mention it), the cheap look and feel of this is much different from my old Animal Complete and I'll probably go with another brand.",1,0,False,0.332873377,0.056777597,255.0,,en,amazon,1,1,2,2,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,True,399.0,0.450384024577573,4.4,amazon,0

4399,4399,22,AMAZON22,So far... So good,D,"I don't usually review until I've used product for @6 weeks. But I'll give initial impression now. First:. Amazon has the best price by far. Even though Revlon provided colors and references for cool-neutral-warm tones, it was difficult for me to choose a color. I'm definitely a ""cool"". But options are seriously scarce. I chose way wrong. So I tried again with a lighter, ""neutral"" color. Light Beige is perfect for my fair skin. After I applied my essence, moisturizer and primer, I used 2-3 pumps and dotted over my face. Consistency is a bit thinner than I'm used to in a foundation; more like a serum. I've used a brush, sponge and my fingers. For me, fingers applied this best. It's a light-medium coverage. I needed just a little more on a couple of age spots (I'm 72-y/o with very dry skin). Blends beautifully. I let it set for 1 minute before continuing with bronzer, blush, and powder. Since I do use a finishing powder, it really lasts all day. Initial impression is good. Love the squalene and hyaluronic acid ingredients. Skin needs all the help it can get. My skin didn't get that dry, tight feeling in the afternoon that I normally get with my other foundation. That surprised me.
I'll let you know after a couple of months if I still love it. BTW... Gave the darker shade to a friend.

Update: lasts 12 hrs with little to no touch-up needed. I don't do strenuous exercise or hang out in humid or hot weather. I'm pretty sure those conditions would warrant some help from my powder compact. Mostly what I notice is that there's no dry feeling. I do use facial mists a few times thru the day. Again... 72-y/o dry skin. But that's just my routine.

I just thought it sounded interesting, and I like a lot of Revlon products. First of all--application. I started to apply with a foundation brush and was immediately disappointed. It looked so sheer, almost like nothing. But I put a pump of it on my finger and started blending, and it was a whole new ball game. Nice coverage, (not full coverage, so if you need that, this isn't for you. ) But at least medium, maybe high medium. So if you try a brush or sponge and don't like it, I encourage you to try your fingers. It blends like a dream. Once it sets it almost feels like you aren't wearing foundation. It's very lightweight. I powder over every foundation, I just can't make myself not use some powder, so I dusted a small amount of powder with a large brush, mostly on my t-zone. It has been on my face for nearly 12 hours, and it still looks good. I was lucky enough to even pick out the right color. I'm fair to light (more fair) and I almost always buy a neutral undertone.

Revlon's Illuminance foundation is great for aging skin like mine. I know I should be using a full coverage formula to cover wrinkles and marks but my skin doesn't take to thick products and I really feel I need something that lets my skin breathe sometimes. I like that the coverage is light. Yes, it doesn't cover every blemish but it makes my skin look soft and fresh. I don't think it was very illuminating unless you count that it didn't make my skin look dry and matte which I don't like. I want a dewy look. I got a somewhat dewy look...if that counts as illuminating. I feel like my face breathes. ONLY THING: I got the wrong color. Technically this is my color match but I always go somewhat darker because of my rosacea and because I like a sun kissed look. This was far too light. I try to make it work.

4532,4532,22,AMAZON22,"Light, Natural Coverage with Dewey Finish",Kate T.,"I absolutely hate the current makeup trends of really heavy foundations which don't really look natural and require the application of a ton of contouring, highlight, bronzer and blush to give the face a ""natural"" looking complexion. It's awful to hear, but skin isn't meant to look flawless and airbrushed and you're really never going to achieve that IG filtered look in real life. With that healthy dose of realism and expectations, I like this foundation for what it is. It is a light, buildable coverage which feels a lot like a nice facial moisturizer going on. It does require some face prep, as it's not hydrating enough if you have any seasonal dryness (like I get in the winter due to dry forced air heat) and will show skin flakiness if not properly prepped. Without a good primer, I did get some creasing of this around my eyes and nose. It allows the natural skin tones to come through - I have naturally rosy cheeks - and I prefer to work with what I have rather than hide everything and try to mimic it in layers. This paired well with my Tarte concealer and I didn't seem to have any product reaction between this foundation and the concealer.

4533,4533,22,AMAZON22,The Perfect Choice for a Flawless and Healthy Look,Dena White,"I recently tried the Revlon Illuminance Skin-Caring Liquid Foundation and was blown away by how amazing it is. Not only does this foundation provide excellent coverage, but it also contains nourishing ingredients that help improve the overall health of your skin.

The formula is lightweight and blends seamlessly into the skin, leaving a natural-looking finish. It's perfect for those who want to achieve a flawless look without feeling like they're wearing heavy makeup.

One of my favorite things about this foundation is that it's long-lasting, so you don't have to worry about touch-ups throughout the day. Plus, it comes in a variety of shades to match any skin tone.

In my opinion, its a pretty good mid grade cosmetic, never really had any issues with their products. This foundation was really easy to apply and matched my skin tone very well because its a medium coverage I think even if it doesnt match exactly you can kind of blend it out to be a better match. It absorbed well into my skin, but I didnt notice it left kind of a greasy feeling and if you have already oily skin like I do, you are trying to avoid any additional greasy/oily products. I feel like this is kind of buildable, but not at the same time due to the fact that its kind of a greasy product and I had to put a setting powder in between applications.

This foundation is great for maturing skin.
Im 40, and I am noticing changes in my skin, when I saw this foundation and the fact that it has Hyaluronic acid in it I wanted to give it a shot.

I actually like this foundation, because I prefer a natural appearance.

At first, I wasnt sure if this color was the right fit, but it is perfect for my skin tone.
The texture is velvety, but a little goes a long way.

I was concerned that this felt a little too oily, but it somehow balanced out after a few minutes after application.

I also have oily skin, so my only con is that it felt greasy initially, but my skin absorbed it.

The coverage for me is medium which I like, and this gives my skin an even tone.

Overall easy to assemble, dimensions as described, and color accurate to product photos. The material may not be the sturdiest for heavier items.

All of the parts came secure in the box, everything was cushioned by Styrofoam and placed neatly. This also came with everything needed to assemble (all labeled clearly) including a small screwdriver and parts for securing to the wall. As others have mentioned the legs are plastic which might be something to keep in mind if wanting to use for heavier items.

The assembly was very easy and the instructions were clear.

One tip:

When putting together the shelves, it's worth standing the whole thing up to be able to get the screws into the shelf dividers properly.

4750,4750,23,AMAZON23,"Good enough and functional, but with lots of cut corners (see details). Conditionally Recommended",C. Okamuro,"Flatpack furniture sure has changed. I got the LEYAOYAO 3-Tier, 7 Cube Bookshelf with the understanding that it was cheap. Considering that this bookshelf was for old magazines in my basement, the primary concern was that the bookshelf be sturdy enough for the contents. The secondary hope was that the piece would more or less go with the neo-mid-century furniture in the basement.

So, on the assembly side, it's about as fussy as you'd imagine. The nature of the design dictates a large number of pieces. A large number of pieces dictates a larger number of hardware items. Still, the design pretty much ensures that there shouldn't be sagging MDF a couple years down the line. The first cost-cutting victim is exposed hardware. I was expecting exposed screws on the sides and bottom, but there are exposed screws on the TOP of the unit, and on top of the shelves with vertical support underneath. That's normally where you'd see cam nuts and bolts, but not here! Is it a big deal? Probably not, but you will have to be careful about what you set on top of the exposed hardware because it's not countersunk, either! Ugh. That's probably something that should have been addressed, in my opinion. I assumed the legs were wood... they're not. The entire leg assembly, including the flange, is black plastic. It doesn't look good, but it's also not a place that people will generally visually scrutinize. The last super-obvious thing is the paneled back. There are 4 particleboard/cardboard slats that are joined with plastic I-channels. First, the color of the channels doesn't quite match the facing. Second, the I-channels are visible from the front... All they needed to do was have the I-channels match up with the shelf lines! Such a missed opportunity, but instead they opted to make the packaging a little smaller.

All of these decisions save money - directly or indirectly. In the end, this allows LEYAOYAO to offer this bookshelf for $81 (with $7 off coupon, at the time of this review). I consider this to be a really good price, for what it is. That said, I do think it makes sense for anyone considering this bookshelf to think of how nice they want that piece of furniture to be.

I'd suggest waiting till it's closer to its frequent sale price of ~100, because while it's a good little bookcase it is still more in the Walmart range of quality for furniture. Basically, that means it's perfectly usable, but slightly rickety (or rather, just prone to swaying), and just generally not a full on buy it for life item. I still think it's really snappy looking, though, and intend to get another to complement the one.

This LEYAOYAO 8 Cube Bookshelf with Base paints a pretty picture in its adverts. In its true form there are some issues that should be considered. The finish is a nice look but all of the screws provided and used are easily seen and do not match the finish. So they are obvious and in your face. The instructions were at least legible and fairly easy to follow, a big deal if you have ever had to put this stuff together without discernable directions. They provide tools but get your own out if you want to make any good time assembling this unit. The issue here is the 'wood' they use is actually pressed pack-sawdust. It strips out with the least bit of torque. I had to use my drill to add new holes and reinforced the framework in several spots with my own screws. It turns out ok if you do not mind the highly visible non-matching screws and the soft easily-strippable wood. I am going to give it a good try and see what happens. You might want to keep this in an out of the way spot until you make your own final decisions.

The boxing came ripped yet put together by tape and you could see Styrofoam pieces coming through the cracks. I know that boxes can get damaged due to traveling in the trucks, so I assumed thats the reason the box looked that way. The box even had a sticker that was marked heavy but it did not feel heavy at all. I go to open it to start putting it together and the Styrofoam gets all over the place... Its all over each piece, all over my living room, and all over my clothes. I start taking out pieces and I knew right away that a lot of the shelving pieces were missing, and they were.
Im surprised that this item has such good reviews, because it does look nice, but I feel like it is still cheap quality. I did not see anyone else note that the legs that support the complete shelving unit are made of plastic. I think whatever you place on these shelves need to be very lightweight like picture frames and maybe a vase or two Small weightless items. I was planning to put Toys, books, puzzles for my daughter and I dont feel that this shelving unit would support the weight of those items.
I obviously had to return it, but if I give any kind of suggestion to anyone thinking of buying this shelf, it is to think about what it is youre going to be putting on the shelves to make sure that they are lightweight enough and to take into consideration the legs are plastic- you could probably not attach them if youd like.. but thats one of the high quality-looking features.

The expected delivery date (was supposed to be September 8th) The label got damaged during scan, and then found out the other box got lost in the mail (in Kansas City) by FedEx, and found out it got delivered to the wrong address. I called Amazon AND the best choice products company. Amazon gave me a partial refund for the income

inconvenience. Best choice products customer service was phenomenal. They sent me a return label by email and had me return the first box at no cost to me. They sent me a replacement, coming from Ontario California. I received the boxes a day late due to operational issues (the boxes got put in the wrong van) so it delayed my shipment, and now received BOTH boxes today (September 26th). All the pieces came together, it's very comfortable, firm but comfortable. The cushions arent squishy or wrinkled as others have said. It's very, very, VERY space saving, very comfortable to lay on, watch tv, and enough room for me and my golden retriever to snuggle on during the cold winter and fall months. I plan on getting a few throw pillows and a couch cover (or put a blanket over it) to make it softer to lay on for naps or reading. I was very nervous about receiving this couch, (based on the mixed reviews) but I am very, very, VERY happy with the couch, and very, very, VERY happy I received everything all in one piece.

4996,4996,24,AMAZON24,I am in love with this couch!,Shelly F,"As someone who has had several spinal fusions comfort is a rarity. However, this couch has been absolutely comfortable to sit and sleep on. It is way better than I expexted, especially for the money. The large cushion is the firmest cushion because of how it is packed it is not crushed as much with the vacuum packing. The three other cushions are medium firmness but still very sturdy. I bought ""never flat"" pillows from dollar general and added them to the back cushions because they just didn't plump up enough for me. The pillows fit perfectly and make the couch even more comfy. The fabric is very durable and easy to clean. Only had it a week before it had blueberry juice spilled in it by the grandbaby. I took a baby wipe (because that was what I had closest at the time) wiped it up and there is absolutely no evidence that there was ever a spill there and we all know bluberry stains everything. I bought the beige couch because it fits my farmhouse style and wondered if it was a mistake because of grandkids, a cat, and even my own clumsiness. I can assure you it was not a mistake after seeing how easily that spill wiped up.

5004,5004,24,AMAZON24,Great little couch,LiftingDad,"My family has really enjoyed this couch. It comes in 2 compact boxes that have each cushion vacuum packed and the other pieces are packed quite well.
I believe it was 2 screws (maybe 1) to get this one assembled. The rest was more of a slip in type of setup where the piece just slides into the hook of another to hold together.
The cushions then are held in place with velcro.
It is not a big couch, but also doesn't have a big price so it works great.
We use this in our finished basement in the ""theater"" area (literally a TV on the wall, we didn't go crazy) and the kids really love to try to be first to lay on the chaise portion of the couch.

The fabric has held up well as we recently got a puppy who is learning how to get up and down on furniture. The fur cleans up easy and his fresh claws haven't done damage thus far.

5100,5100,24,AMAZON24,Cushions need improvement,Christopher LaMar,"I'll start with packaging. They did a great job at making everything fit inside two boxes and they both arrived on time.

Putting it together was a breeze, took me about 20 mins. The way it fits together is very simple and it really doesn't require any tools, which is really convenient but you loose some quality because of it. The way the sections are combined does not give enough support for the couch unless its against the wall which most people will have it like that so if that's your plan then you don't have to worry about it all that much. Also the way the arm section connects to the long section is just two brackets that snap together so if you have kids then you will be scared they are going to break it.

Due to saving as much space as possible with the packaging the cushions need some fluffing in order to feel alright but they flatten out pretty fast. Best remedy is adding some foam inside the back of the cushions which is a cheap fix and make the couch a lot more comfortable.

Overall the couch is decent, I feel like for the price it should be sturdier and more comfortable out of the box but it is a couch I ordered online so I can complain.

5102,5102,24,AMAZON24,Good Sofa For Your Buck,Mikheil N.,"The sofa looks stylish and modern, and it fits perfectly in my living room. The assembly process was easy and straightforward, and I was able to put it together in no time. If your room is not very big, this is the perfect size.

The ""ottoman"" is removable, so it can either be an L-shaped sofa, or a slightly larger loveseat with an extra ottoman.

However, I must admit that while the sofa is comfortable to sit on, it's slightly less comfortable to lie on. I was hoping for a more plush and cozy feel, but the cushions are a bit firm, and the backrest is not as comfortable as I would like. Nonetheless, I still find myself spending a lot of time on the sofa, and I appreciate its durability and sturdiness. The fabric feels of high quality, and I can tell that it will last me for years to come.

I recommend it - it's also really slick and beautiful.",4,37,True,0.568572261,0.300075758,159.0,,en,amazon,0,0,1,1,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,True,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,False,359.99,0.4985294117647059,4.0,amazon,1

5105,5105,24,AMAZON24,Nice little couch,grace truex,"What I liked:
1. Arrived 1 day ahead of schedule
2. Its easy to assemble and I was able to assemble it by myself

What could be better:
1. The cushions are pretty stiff- IMO this isnt a bad thing but for comfort purposes, I say the cushions could be a little less stiff
2. For some unknown reason the 2 pieces that connect are crooked which makes the couch uneven. Thankfully , this issue isnt a major problem and isnt super easily noticeable. But again, due to the asymmetry, I would say the product could be improved.
3. The cushions are wrinkly even after having steamed them. I know that due to the way the product is packaged, this issue is inevitable but I still wanted to mention it as it is something very noticeable.

Overall, I am generally happy with this purchase. It was affordable so I am not surprised by the minuscule issues that this couch comes with. If you are looking for a cheap couch that arrives on time and is easy to set up, I would recommend this couch.

The legs are plastic and seem a little cheap and I may eventually switch to sturdier legs.

5228,5228,24,AMAZON24,Quality lowers quickly,KDIXIT,"Assembly was easy and straightforward. I was able to build the couch by myself. The cushions were very wrinkled and needed ironed. I had many people think it was a used couch because of how wrinkled the couch appeared.

Within the first couple weeks, the inner material on the long cushion developed a ridge on the front edge and went flat everywhere else. I have tried to fluff the material to no avail. One of the back wood pieces cracked within the first week as well.

5230,5230,24,AMAZON24,Wrong color part sent!,Vish,"First, its a beautiful couch. Easy assembly. Some of the cushions were wrinkled from shipping, but a steamer solved the problem (got this idea from other reviews). However, the couch is shipped in two boxes. Heres where it gets fun

I received two different colors. Collectively, it makes a full couch. However I paid extra for the tan color. One box contained tan pieces, which we ordered, the other contained gray. I (gullibly) didnt realize until after unpacking both boxes that the pieces were different colors. Living in NYC, I dragged this up five flights of stairs myself. After unpacking, theres no realistic way to fit the pieces back into the box it came in.

Its just pretty frustrating that I payed extra for a particular color, and even worse for the mix up of the boxes. The thought of having to find another box of appropriate size and printing a shipping label to return the pieces, amongst dragging it down five flights of stairs again, only to be left with half a couch (for who knows how long) is extremely unsettling.",2,0,True,0.495555556,0.022777778,180.0,,en,amazon,1,0,2,2,3.30935960591133,1.5773516157072096,False,3.126305418719212,17.144037474745417,False,0.5330922122896375,0.189711223340054,False,0.1722673488734501,0.2774839185238517,False,65.98660098522167,79.26217589969231,False,359.99,0.4985294117647059,4.0,amazon,0

5273,5273,24,AMAZON24,Utter Garbage,Berto,"Wow. I really dont know where to begin. The holes dont line up, the construction is remarkably shoddy, the parts are uneven and dont fit together properly. The feet dont sit flush against the bottom of the couch, theres a 4mm gap on one half of the center feet, so its only a matter of time until it fails.
Its also super uncomfortable. The smaller cushions are less dense foam than the large cushion, and slightly different thicknesses. The back is also much shorter than it looks, which means sitting in it is awkward.
You also cant return it without paying $75, and its impossible to get back into the box anyway since all the cushions are vacuum sealed and they triple in size once opened.
Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This couch will make you very sad.
UPDATE: its been nine months, and it just gets worse. The center of the couch is collapsing, the cushion foam is deteriorating, and when my girlfriend and I sit on the couch together, we shock each other with static electricity whenever one of us moves.
My roommates are like well, I guess thats what we get for $200. Except it was $420.

While this is a decent vacuum in terms of the quality of the suction and the lack of tendency to clog, that's pretty much where the benefits for me end, other than the quality of the pet hair vacuuming attachment. Overall for a product coming from a company that touts itself as an engineering company, this isn't terrible well engineered, especially from an optimum function, usability and ergonomics standpoint. There are a number of very glaring shortcomings and a host of smaller, but still annoying others. The extension wand and hose design are two of the biggest things about this that are poor from a design standpoint, but especially ergonomics. The hose tension is way too high/strong, so you are constantly fighting with it to stay extended when you're using the wand and/or the pet attachment - so you waste energy fighting it and it's taxing on the hands to use for more than a couple of minutes, especially if you're like me and have nerve damage in your hands (or you likely would if you're old or arthritic) and you're trying to vacuum carpeted stairs for 10+ minutes. You'll find you end up having to constantly either hold the main part of the vacuum with a hand or a foot to keep the vacuum from snapping back at you when you're using the hose and/or wand, because the hose tension is too high and pulls the body of the vacuum at you. Add in the wand function, which is annoying because it sits inside the hose, so you have to extend it and lock it into the end of the house to use it, especially with the attachments. Or, if you just want to use the hose, you have to pull the wand all the way out and detach it, before connecting attachments. This design is awful in my opinion. What's more, the way the wand/hose assembly sits inside the back of the handle of the vacuum, makes for a sloppy feeling handle when using in regular vacuum function, particularly side to side. You can feel the play between the overly flexible handle assembly and the hose in the back, which means you have to use more exertion than you should to move the vacuum around, especially side to side. I expect that with years of use, the handle, being an incomplete piece of plastic, will eventually snap off. Another major annoyance with this is the the lock mechanimsm to keep the vacuum upright is poor, it routinely disengages and the vacuum falls over, especially when using the wand/hose extended. I've had this fall over and ding furniture, hit me in the head Can't say I'm a fan of the ball assembly to be honest, it doesn't really help with mobility enough, likely because it's too big and creates too much of a pivot point relative to exertion. Because of its size, as many have noted, you can forget about getting it under furniture to vacuum. Coupled with the weight of this vacuum, it's not the easiest to maneuver. Another deficiency on this it the lack of a cord management. Once unwrapped to vacuum with, this has no clip to keep the cord up and out of the way, which forces you to spool the long cord in your non-vacuum pushing hand, so you don't trip, or roll over the cord continually with the vacuum.",2,14,True,0.41199743,0.023683369,601.0,https://www.target.com/p/dyson-ball-animal-3-extra-upright-vacuum/-/A-85269264,en,target,2,2,2,2,4.474938033599559,1.0120760021224582,True,0.2601211787386395,1.768407331440821,True,0.5881957834087435,0.1946524205142727,False,0.3402695883685507,0.2740037304601841,False,33.22693472872487,33.387976993539766,True,499.99,0.4135238095238094,4.2,Target,1

6784,6784,20,TARGET20,"The good, the bad, and the questionable.",Just Some Guy,"Our last vacuum was a DC-07. Used it for 18 years. It was a great vacuum overall, and would still be going strong today, but my wife needs something easier to handle due to her bad back. She narrowed her choices down to two vacuums: the Ball Animal 3, and a competitor's. Obviously, given our positive experience with the DC-07, we went with the Dyson, and also because the competitor's model still uses bags (seriously?) which we didn't want to deal with. In terms of engineering, the Ball Animal 3 is impressive. The suction is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's so powerful that in some cases--like bathroom rugs, hallway runners, etc--it's actually a detriment because the rug buckles as you're pulling the vacuum back. My wife likes the head design; it's lower to the ground so it can get into tighter spaces under chairs, etc. I also like that you can see the brush bar while operating the vacuum, so you know whether it's spinning or needs to be cleaned. So as far as engineering and technology are concerned, the Ball Animal 3 is fantastic. The vacuum's Achille's heal, however, is its ergonomics. This is not an easy vacuum to use, and requires a fair amount of strength to push around. I'm 6'3"" 250+ lbs, and by the time I'm finished vacuuming with the Ball Animal 3, my shoulder feels like it's going to fall off, and my back hurts for about a half hour afterwards, from the coccyx up to the middle. If *I'm* this stiff, sore, sweating like a pig, and gasping for air after using the vacuum, imagine what it must be like for my poor wife and her bad back! This vacuum does not ""roll"" or ""glide"" across the carpet, and frankly I also feel it's a lot harder to maneuver. On a positive note, though, the clutch mechanism is in a much more user-friendly location now (an electronic switch next to the power button versus having to bend over and manipulate a mechanical knob); but then Dyson goes and cancels it out by putting the suction adjustment slider in an even more inconvenient location than where the DC-07 clutch knob was. My wife likes the wand on this unit better than the DC-07. I disagree, but I do like that the tools can be directly attached to the hose now. That's probably the best improvement Dyson made, ergonomically speaking. Unfortunately, the main chassis/body still ""follows"" you around whenever you stretch the hose, getting in the way and making the job harder. The on-board storage of the tools isn't very good, either, and seems like it was more of an afterthought. The brush bar is much easier to remove on the Ball Animal 3. It's more of a sleeve that fits over the actual rotating mechanism, so no special tool is required to disconnect the drive belt from the roller bar. Lastly, both filters on the Ball Animal 3 are washable (the post-motor filter on the DC-07 wasn't washable and had to be replaced periodically, and was difficult to access). Now as for the construction of the Ball Animal 3, that remains in question. Some of the plastic, particularly in the handle and the flip-up wand end cap, is really flimsy and bends way too much. I feel like it's going to snap or permanently deform at any moment. However, being open-minded, perhaps the flexibiltiy helps _prevent_ the plastic from snapping. I don't know. Time will tell. I'm torn. On the one hand, I want the Ball Animal 3 to give us 18+ years of reliable service like the DC-07 did; but on the other hand, I am not looking forward to my wife and I (especially her) having to lug this thing around while using it.

As many other reviews state this Dyson model has strong suction power. This vacuum has the strongest suction power and cleans dirt that you didnt even know existed. The trade off for the strong suction power is that you do have to adjust the height on the power head to work properly on your carpet. On my carpet runner I have to set it to the highest level even though the carpet is thin to vacuum because of the power as it trys to suction up the runner. On larger area rugs with not as high of a pile I can use the medium level and on my fluffy carpet I use the highest pile. On my hardwood floors I use it on the lowest level and turn off the brush bar. I love the no tangle hair brush bar. Even long curly hair hasnt stuck on the brush bar. My little dog didnt care for the pet attachment and definitely dont try it on your cats! I would say the one thing that I wish Dyson would improve on are the accessories. They really arent any different from the previous model and in my opinion I wasnt a fan of the turbine tool it kind of just flung dirt.

6805,6805,20,TARGET20,Great Suction,Dladd,Love this vacuum. It does a fantastic job getting the hair up from my golden retriever and 3 cats. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hose for stretching the vacuum up the stairs does not come close to the full length advertised. At the full length stretched I cant get to the last 2-3 steps and at that point the vacuum falls over and starts getting pulled up the stairs. FYI I also find that the upholstery attachment gets the animal hair out of the stair runner rug and carpet better than the stair tool. By the way the upholstery tool is unbelievably amazing. It makes quick work out of getting cat hair off chairs and couches. Truly awesome! This vacuum is so amazing that the less than stellar stair hose does not keep me from loving it. I am truly in love with this vacuum. I am very happy with this purchase. I do hope Dyson will lengthen the stair hose though.

6834,6834,20,TARGET20,Good but disappointing,gezp,The vacuum has great suction as one can expect from a dyson but it comes at the expense of maneuverability in that it is very difficult to push across rugs. It is especially hard on low pile rugs even when you adjust for it via the switch. The location of the switch for adjusting between low pile vs longer and hardwood is on the head of the vacuum so you have to bend over to reach every time which is inconvenient. The hose is also difficult to use because the suction is so strong that the hose doesnt extend and the vacuum also tips over so the only way I could use it if my partner held the vacuum upright while I tried to stretch it on areas like blinds.

Its not that it doesnt have great suction - it does - but its too much. I have a low pile rug and it took a lot of force to vacuum it (and for the record I promise you Im not a weak human!). Even putting that aside, the handle felt like at any minute it was going to snap in half. It felt like a toy and I was constantly afraid that doing a basic cleaning task would somehow shatter it. I also feel like I have to say that if you keep a fairly clean house and clean semi-regularly then I dont know if you need this level of auction. Even if you have pets and kids but Im a bit obsessive about being fairly clean. I do have a toddler that somehow is always sandy but I still dont think I needed this vacuum.

6870,6870,20,TARGET20,Great for dog lovers who appreciate a clean home!,maggie0116,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum is extremely powerful and great for dog hair. I have 2 huskies that shed a lot and their hair is often stuck on the couch, carpet, and rugs. I previously had a Dyson Ball Multi Floor 2 and I needed to go over the rug a few times before getting all the dog hair out, but I only have to go over it once with this vacuum. Previous Dyson brush bars were a two-piece design that left a small area where the vacuum brushes would not vacuum requiring you go over the same area again to vacuum the missed spot. With this being a single-piece brush bar, the entire width has bristles to remove debris and it makes a big difference. Inside the cleaner head, there are also plastic spikes that clean the hair off the bristles as it spins. This saves a lot of time not having to clean the head and vacuum some places again. The Tangle-free Turbine tool attachment is amazing! It is extremely useful for removing hair on furniture and car mats. It is much better than similar tools used. The initial setup out of the box was tool-free and very simple. Where the cleaner head attaches to the motor has an updated design from previous models so some older interchangeable heads won't be able to attach.

I was stoked to see what new features they had added and new items I could destroy people with. Unfortunately, I feel like Diddy Kong Racing is still a far better game (yes, a Nintendo 64 game is better than this). This struggles with the classic issues MarioKart has always had. Computers inexplicably catching up and passing you at unrealistic speeds at the worst possible moments. The same old courses with ""updates."" To their defense, they did add a new battle mode that's all the rage. On the back of the case, it says you can hold two items for double the firepower like it's some kind of new feature. Nope, it just means you can hold two items at once, and fire them one at a time. Honestly, I feel like Nintendo has lost their imagination and needs to add some features that are actually new.

I was a little intimidated and apprehensive to use the Ninja Woodfire Outdoor Grill when I first got it but, I am learning how to use all of it's functions and actually enjoying our new level of cooking. This outdoor oven is very versatile. Smoker, broiler, baker, dehydrator and roaster all in one appliance makes it the favorite outdoor appliance. The front control panel is easy to see and use. You only need to change the cooking function, temperature, time and if you want the woodfire flavor smoke added to your cooking choice. The pizza setting has extra custom settings to use, which includes what type of pizza you are cooking (frozen, thin crust, etc.) and will preheat the pizza stone for you so the crust comes out perfect each time! I love how easy the instruction book is to read and follow. It includes basic recipes for beginners to help ease into the outdoor oven. The package also included a pack of woodfire pellets. The all-purpose blend flavor gave our roast a mild woodfire flavor and turned our mac n cheese flavor into the most flavorful mac n cheese we have ever had! The smoker feature is the best feature in my opinion! The oven is easy to clean and several parts are dishwasher safe.

19455,19455,18,TARGET18,Fantastic for making great pizza quick!,jackh,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My family is really big on cooking, especially pizza. We used a traditional kitchen oven to create our pizzas, and while that was bearable, we were looking for an upgrade to our pizza game. This Ninja Woodfire Oven is quite literally my favorite pickup of the year so far. There's no way to really describe how different it makes them other than you'd have to see it for yourself. Temps go up to 700 F which is insanely hot for a consumer electric oven, cooks evenly and quickly, and brings our homemade foods like our pizzas to the next level. I attached a couple images with my review, the pictures of the pizza were first attempts at using the oven on the Neapolitan setting. They came out beautifully, and they tasted like they came from a restaurant. Getting the oven up to temperature doesn't take long at all, and it only takes a couple minutes to cook your pizza, no turns needed. We like our pizzas just a bit on the burnt side, so we left ours in for another minute (after 3 minutes), and made a great ""coal-fired"" style similar to what you would find at a pizza shop that uses extremely hot ovens. There's a variety of modes for any type of food that you'd want to cook, and also an area to add wood pellets to add a ""smoky"" flavor to whatever you want. We have been using this oven for the past week with no complaints or flaws that come in our way. It's very simple to use, comes with potential recipies to use with it, works and operates how you think it should, and is easy to move, so going to a friend's house for a backyard cook, or for storage, is easy to do. We plan on getting the stand and cover that's for purchase so we can keep it outside instead of bringing it in every time. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and very happy with this oven, and it brought my pizza-making skills to the next level with no effort.",5,0,False,0.578463203,0.202777778,357.0,https://www.target.com/p/ninja-woodfire-pizza-oven-8-in-1-outdoor-oven-5-pizza-settings-smoker-ninja-woodfire-technology-electric-oo101/-/A-89401843,en,target,1,1,1,1,4.474938033599559,1.0120760021224582,False,0.2601211787386395,1.768407331440821,False,0.5881957834087435,0.1946524205142727,False,0.3402695883685507,0.2740037304601841,False,33.22693472872487,33.387976993539766,True,399.99,0.4839813311688312,4.7,Target,0

19691,19691,19,TARGET19,Solid cooler but not prefect,Crow,"The inside is much smaller than you would expect considering how big and bulky the outside is. The handle sticks out on the sides enough to take up even more extra space in my car. The grip is comfortable though, so it's got that going on at least. Carrying it can be a bit awkward but that's to be expected of any cooler with these dimensions. I only use the handle to lift it and carry it on my shoulder instead even when fully loaded. Quality wise, my only complaint is the seal was cut slightly shorter than it should be so there's a small section it doesn't cover. Other than that, it's very well made and sturdy enough to sit or stand on (185lbs here). Performance has been good so far. I completely filled it with cold food and four 4x6x0.5in ice packs and two quart sized ice cubes and the big ice cubes didn't fully melt after 4 days. The cooler was outside in the shade during 70-80 days while camping. I also used it to bring back several frozen ice packs back home with the other 2/3-1/2 of the volume being cold beers. The cooler was in my trunk for about 30hrs with direct sunlight hitting it at around 80 weather. When I got home, the ice packs were halfway melted, but 2 beer bottles were partially frozen, and the beer can I cracked open was 33.6 cold. Like I said, it's got its quirks but preforms solidly, particularly for the price. Due to the small capacity, I'm replacing it with a bigger cooler from another brand so that my gf and I can take more food and drinks when camping. This one is now mainly for when I camp alone, day trips, or freshwater fishing (plus it's the perfect size to sit). Plus, I actually love the look of it!",4,2,False,0.478100775,0.030620155,314.0,https://www.target.com/p/igloo-imx-24qt-cooler-meteorite/-/A-87378961,en,target,1,1,1,1,4.474938033599559,1.0120760021224582,False,0.2601211787386395,1.768407331440821,True,0.5881957834087435,0.1946524205142727,False,0.3402695883685507,0.2740037304601841,False,33.22693472872487,33.387976993539766,True,94.99,0.5530864197530863,4.3,Target,1

Its a little awkward to carry fully loaded with the handle as it is. Wish to maybe have seen a few handles on the side like the IMX 70. One other thing I did notice is it is not leak proof. There is the gasket yes, but if it does tip on its side water will leak out...Overall a very well built and practical cooler for day or weekend trips!
