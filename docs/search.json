Our work focuses on the expansion and generalization of their multiple linear regression model. To check the model’s general applicability, we collect additional products and reviews, and do so for the same products from multiple e-commerce websites to examine whether such models are applicable to any platform, or if the models may be platform-specific. Furthermore, we explore use of additional features and coefficients, and use of other prediction and classification models to assess the degree to which a customer review is useful to future customers.",

    "text": "1.2 Concept and Motivation\n\nCustomers, when searching for products with specific features and aspects, need sufficient information to make a decision as to whether to procure a specific product. According to research by Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022), if a customer can gather and understand product quality before the purchase, it is considered a search good, while experience goods are those which must be purchased or experienced to evaluate them. When a product is more in the directon of experience vs. search-based, other customers’ experiences can shed light on its features and return on investment than information directly from the vendor can. Having reviews from reliable sources with sufficiently detailed information can enable greater confidence in a purchase, improved customer satisfaction, and smooth the process of ecommerce for customers.\nWe seek to expound upon the research of (Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul 2022) to explore additional recommended research areas to improve upon and increase the general applicability of the model.",

    "section": "1.4 Why It Matters",
    "text": "1.4 Why It Matters\n\nFeedback from customers can be beneficial to both vendors and consumers, but it is not always ordered by the most informative or beneficial feedback first. Certain features of products, reviews, and reviewers (such as reviewer reliability, review quality, product quality, specificity and detail of the product, amongst others) can impact the usefulness of the feedback on a customer-by-customer basis. Level of detail, star-rating, and number of votes that support the review as being useful to a customer can all help determine its usefulness to other customers. Leveraging metrics and data associated with a product, a review, and a reviewer together may allow for online vendors to improve consumer e-commerce experience, support identificaion of issues with product quality and sales, and enable vendors to adjust practices in product marketing, inventory, and manufacture.\nExamining additional product types could support a generalization of the authors’ methodology to other products. Furthermore, the exploration of a sliding scale for search vs. experience-based products can further support generalization and business goals. Producing a reliable scale and methods for classifying a products’ degree of being experienced-based can inform vendors on:\n\nHow to best sort product reviews.\nExamine what are the most helpful reviews to know the performance of the product alongside customer experience and sentiment.\nAdjust the product, its marketing, or future production based upon market efficacy.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the emotions a customer wants to express through a review is crucial as it will affect the “recommendation score” of that particular product or a different one from a similar category. \n\nTo contribute in determining this recommendation score, we can use a probabilistic machine learning algorithm like Naive Bayes to determine the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of customer reviews.\nTypically used for amending product design, Kansei Engineering can be used to incorporate human emotional responses into evaluation of a customer review. \n\nDetermine which customer is trustworthy, meaning who has actually purchased the product versus a customer who gave a false review. Based on the ‘customer reputation score’, our aim is to classify customers into groups to judge reviewer reliability. This has two main aspects:\n\nStar-rating score which is a discrete scale that tells the inclination of a customer.\nText review ‘sentiment score’ using NLP that explains customer opinions based on words.",

    "text": "2.2 Data Collection Details\nIn collecting our data, in order to adhere to the model implemented by Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022), we required the following data points:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nProduct Title\nstring\n\n\nProduct Category*\nstring\n\n\nProduct Details/Specs\nstring\n\n\nProduct Cost\nfloat\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the product category variable - we may add our own manual categorization. Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022) manually set the value for this variable. Part of the intent of our research is to seek out means and methods to replace this variable with a continuous scale (ranging from 0 for a “search” good, to a 1 for an “experience” good).\nAs an initial proxy for this variable and to operationalize it, we leverage a measure of subjectivity for the product - namely how subjective (e.g. how many adverb, adjective, and other word modifiers) are present within the details and specifications of a product. A product that more aligns to a “search” product, we hypothesize, will have fewer modifying words and be oriented toward the facts of the object.\nFor example, a desk has specific dimensions for length, width, and height, an associated weight, and material from which the desk is made, and possibly some warranty information - all of which are likely to be contained within the product description and specifications. We would characterize such a good as a “search” good (or a 0 on our scale). Leveraging existing language processing tools should allow us to calculate a value for subjectivity in the product’s description and specifications.\nInitially, we’ll explore product subjectivity in the combination of the specification and the description, though it may be necessary to explore product subjectivity solely within one of these fields or the other to pursue our modeling.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Review Data Required\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nVerified Purchase\nboolean\n\n\nStar Rating\nfloat\n\n\nReview Content\nstring\n\n\nUseful Votes\ninteger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 2.1, we outline the specific datapoints we sought out for reviews across each website. Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022) leveraged star rating, review content (specifically the review length), and the number of votes for the review being useful as key measures in their research. To further their work, we plan on exploring the impacts of verified product purchasers and the impact of verification on how useful a review may be to potential customers.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Additional Calculated Columns, Post Data Collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nProduct Subjectivity\nfloat\n\n\nReview Length (Words)\ninteger\n\n\nReview Subjectivity\nfloat\n\n\nReview Polarity\nfloat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost collection, we added the calculations listed in Table 2.2 to our review data and product data (less reputation score). Each of these calculations will allow us to better understand our underlying data and explore possibilities of where and how each may fit into models for review usefulness.\nWe have also established a master listing of all products for which we collected data and have associated arbitrary identifiers with the products. In instances where we’ve successfully pulled data for identical products from multiple websites, it can allow us to explore the impact on product and review metrics and investigate the listing site as a treatment variable.\nFor instance - exploring the impact of review subjectivity, polarity, length, and usefulness, based upon which site the product was listed.",

    "text": "2.3 Data Collection Procedures\nWe wrote code to allow us to gather information from each website. The general process for each e-commerce platform is similar. To alleviate any unnecessary burden for any of these websites, we manually identified URLs to the specific products we sought out to gather, and wrote our code to iterate through those URLs and pull the necessary data and features we sought. This manual identification also allowed us to ensure, in most cases, that we were getting the exact same product during data capture. This hybrid approach enabled higher certainty in getting the same product while also accelerating collection, structuring, and cleaning of product review information.\n\nGathering from Amazon (All Products)\n\nProduct & Review data was scraped from Amazon’s website using Python and Selenium. A Selenium WebDriver was utilized to automate web browser interactions. After navigating to product categories like electronics, home appliances, furniture, books, and grocery, Selenium’s functions were employed to locate review elements. These elements were then parsed and collected, storing the data in a structured format i.e. a CSV file. Pagination handling was implemented to scrape reviews from multiple pages.\n\nChallenge: Amazon’s product “All Reviews” webpage HTML structure had 10 reviews per page with a “Next Page” navigation button that was clickable only up-to 10 review pages. This restricted our scope of the number of reviews being scraped per product to a maximum of 100.\nSolution: Instead of scraping based on the “All Reviews” webpage, we decided to scrape reviews based on “star-rating” thereby, increasing our scope from a total of 100 reviews per product to having a maximum of 100 reviews per star rating i.e. 5*100 = 500 reviews per product.\n\n\nGathering from BestBuy (Electronic Products, Furniture Item(s)? - no grocery or clothing)\n\nJust like Target and Amazon, even BestBuy has dynamic content on its web page. We employed Python with Selenium to automate the exploration of product pages, unveiling hidden content, and harvesting essential data. Employing Selenium’s functionalities, we initiated the traversal process, enabling the program to automatically expand pertinent sections to uncover additional information. By targeting elements such as product details and reviews, we orchestrated the seamless extraction of critical fields from each product’s page. This automated approach allowed us to efficiently parse through an extensive array of reviews, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of user feedback for the products under scrutiny. We systematically stored the extracted data in our records tables for further analysis and reference.\n\nGathering from Target (All products)\n\nTarget has dynamic content on their webpages. We used Python Selenium to navigate to product pages and automate the selection of items needed to expand sections to reveal additional data. We also automated the process of expanding out all reviews so as to iterate through and parse the content of every review for each product in question.",

    "text": "2.5 Data Exploration and Visualization\nFor our data exploration, we plan to examine solely the reviews for which we have data from all of our websites. Due to the nature of the vendors, not all offer the same products online. We’ve included some unique products from each site (and may even gather more), but will exclude them from initial analysis.\nThe common items between all 3 websites include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproduct_title\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G Unlocked (128GB) Smartphone - Burgundy\n\n\nHP DeskJet 2755e Wireless All-In-One Color Printer, Scanner, Copier with Instant Ink and HP+ (26K67)\n\n\nJBL Charge 5 Portable Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker - Target Certified Refurbished\n\n\nTurboTax 2023 Deluxe Federal and State Tax Software\n\n\nHamilton Beach 4 slice Toaster 24782\n\n\nLG 65\" Class 4K UHD 2160p Smart OLED TV - OLED65C3\n\n\nGE JES1460DSBB 1.4 Cu. Ft. Black Counter Top Microwave\n\n\nDoritos Nacho Cheese Flavored Tortilla Chips - 14.5oz\n\n\nCrest Cavity & Tartar Protection Toothpaste, Baking Soda & Peroxide - 5.7oz/3pk\n\n\nOXO POP 3pc Plastic Food Storage Container Set Clear\n\n\nHogwarts Legacy - Xbox Series X\n\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor - PlayStation 5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for only examining common products is to check for comparability and similarity of the products associated variables (e.g. product subjectivity, review subjectivity, review polarity, star rating, and so forth) between the websites. If they are similar or comparable, it may mean that we could use single models to make predictions on the usefulness of customer feedback. If they are substantially dissimilar, it may mean that modifiers are needed based upon the e-commerce platform in which the product is listed.\nWe’ll start by looking at distributions of some of these key variables, and check some of the common trends between them, potentially moving on to hypothesis testing of these variables to check for statistically significant differences.\n\n2.5.1 Univariate Plots and Distributions\nFirst, we want to examine the review content across all websites in a single, simple visual - a Wordcloud. Seeing common words and phrases can prime us for what we might expect to see in more detailed statistical plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Wordcloud of review content\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining the Wordcloud, some larger words stick out (“easy”, “good”, “love”, “need” and “great”). There don’t seem to be very many negative singular words here as it pertains to these reviews. This may suggest that the content of reviews, generally, gravitates toward positivity in reviews. We will proceed to examine this with appropriate statistical plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Histogram Plot (star-rating, by-site)\n\n\n\n\n\nExamining the histogram plots for star-rating by website, we can see that, generally, reviews tend to provide more positive than negative feedback for the selected products, supporting what we see coming out of Figure 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Q-Q plots (star-rating, by-site)\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all three websites, there appears to be consistency with adherence to, and issues with, the normal distribution for subjectivity. These charts suggest sufficient normal distribution of review subjectivity (degree of inclusion of word modifiers such as adverbs and adjectives).\nTherre seems to be slight skewness in the tails of these Q-Q distributions. Filtering off some of the outliers may grant us reasonable relevance and assurance to perform hypothesis testing and evaluation of these variables across sites (e.g. ANOVA, F-Testing, etc).\nWe’ll try plotting the same Q-Q plot with outliers removed. To remove outliers, initially, we leveraged the inter-quartile range of each variable and excluded any records for which the variable was more than \\(1.5\\cdot \\text{IQR}\\) away from the 1st and 3rd quartiles.\nBefore we proceed to re-examining the Q-Q plot with outliers removed, we’ll examine boxplots for these variables to examine the prevalence of outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Boxplots - Review Star Rating\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots for star ratings on both Target and Amazon are generally higher with outliers on the lower-end of the 1 to 5 scale. Amazon, however, seems to have a wider spread of information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Boxplots - Review Polarity\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots for reviewe polarity suggest common threads between BestBuy and Target in terms of the number summary (min, max, quartiles, and outliers at the lower end). More notably, the polarity (or how positive or negative the content of the reviews are) generally tends toward positive. Amazon, on the otherhand, seems to show a lower center of mass and a narrower spread, with outliers to both extremes for positive and negative polarity.\nNext, we’ll examine subjectivity in the same fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Boxplots - Review Subjectivity\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjectivity, generally, seems to follow the same trends as review polarity. This suggests that these reviews could come from similar or the same population in terms of polarity and subjectivity. Further statistical analysis would be needed to make a definitive determination here.\nNow that we’ve examined the centers and spread for these variables and understand where some of their outliers may exist, we’ll examine filtering those outliers from their Q-Q plots.\nFirst - Subjectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Q-Q plots (star-rating, by-site, outliers removed)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that our adjustment for outliers sufficiently made corrections for normality across the sites to better adhere to the normal distribution on the lower tail. We may need to make further adjustments on the upper tail to further refine data selection for our training dataset. Amongst the over 34K reviews in the common dataset, approximately 25.4K reviews remain after removing these outliers using this method.\nAfter identifying additional means to filter the data, these methods should suffice in support of using review subjectivity as a feature within various models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Q-Q plots (star-rating, by-site)\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to review subjectivity, review polarity has good adherence to the normal distribution (particularly on the quantile interval of [-2,2]). There are similar issues in the tails of these distributions as exist for review subjectivity.\nAs such, reduction in outliers may enable us to perform hypothesis testing during our model design and implementation. We’ll examine the same methods of outlier removal as we did for review subjectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Q-Q plots (polarity, by-site, oultiers removed)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method of removal seems to mirror that of review subjectivity, and as such, additional fitration of the dataset will be necessary to enable this feature’s use within various models.\nAnother key distribution we must understand is that of our targeted response variable - how useful a review is, as voted by other customers. We’ll plot the response as a pure density plot to explore it’s shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Distribution of Review Helpful Votes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe black lines represent random samples from the exponential distribution (with \\(E[X] = 1.9\\cdot\\bar{V}\\) with \\(\\bar{V}\\) being the mean for helpful votes within the distribution), and the green lines represent the distribution of helpful votes. It seems that, roughly, the distribution of helpful votes does follow the exponential distribution in the case of Amazon and Target.\n\nExamining the plot of Figure 2.10, the distribution of helpful votes appears to be exponentially distributed on a per-website basis, with many reviews having an expected total count of helpful votes centered fairly low.\nKnowing the distribution of our selected response variable will assist us in the modeling process. The nature of the response variable’s distribution may require us to perform transformations on features and responses (e.g. if we pursue a multiple linear regression model).\n\n\n2.5.2 Bi/Multivariate Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Bivariate Plot for Sensitivity and Polarity, by Site (all purchases)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Bivariate Plot for Sensitivity and Polarity, by Site (verified purchases)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.11 and Figure 2.12, we observe the comparison of multiple features like review polarity, review subjectivity and verified purchases in the form of a Kernel Densoty Plot. The 2 different visuals depict the difference between the whole dataset and after the filter of verified_purchase = 1 is applied. This difference may lead to variations in the distribution and relationship between subjectivity and polarity of reviews across different sites, particularly if there are differences in the characteristics of verified and non-verified purchases.\nWe can see 2 major clusters at (0,0) which are mostly outliers where a review is very short in length. The second cluster around the area where subjectivity is about 0.5 suggests that as the review increases in subjectivity, i.e. the higher an opinionated a review is, the polarity also increases.\nThe isolated data points or “islands” outside of the main clusters suggest outliers or unique instances within the dataset. These isolated points may represent reviews that deviate significantly from the overall patterns observed in the data. They could indicate rare or extreme cases that warrant further investigation. For instance, these outliers might correspond to highly subjective or polarized reviews that are not typical of the majority of reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Violin Plots of Review Star-Rating vs. Subjectivity, by Site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Violin Plots for Star Rating vs. Polarity, by Site\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14, we see a trend for the median polarity and subjectivity of each review to increase as the star rating increases. We also see that, generally, the data suggest that we have a minimum of neutral polarity that tends towards positive as star rating increases.\nSince both median subjectivity and polarity seem to increase with respect to star rating, such a correlation could be useful to us in multiple linear regression, and is generally useful to us for consideration when pursuing model development.\n\n\n2.5.3 Hypothesis Testing for Key Feature and Response Variables\nSome key features we plan to explore in our modeling include review subjectivity and review polarity. Knowing whether or not there is a significant difference for these features between the websites on which they’re hosted will inform us during model selection, design, and implementation. As such, we’ll perform ANOVA and Tukey Honest Significant Difference Tests on these variables between each site.\n\n2.5.3.1 ANOVA Testing\nTo perform our ANOVA testing, we’ll evaluate each dataset’s review polarity and subjectivity as the mean measure, and the website on which the review was posted as the treatment variable. Prior to performing our one-way ANOVA, we’ll filter the datasets down to eliminate outliers, such that the data may represent the outcomes depicted in Figure 2.7 and Figure 2.9. An assumption of ANOVA testing is that the source data (and its respective groups) adhere to the normal distribution.\nWe are leveraging Welch ANOVA and operating under an assumption that the variances between the groups are not equal, as visually evidenced in Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6.\nHypotheses:\n\nTest 1:\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu_{\\text{Subj,Amazon}}=\\mu_{\\text{Subj,BestBuy}}=\\mu_{\\text{Subj,Target}}\\)\n\\(H_1:\\) at least one mean for review subjectivity is different.\n\nTest 2:\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu_{\\text{Polr,Amazon}}=\\mu_{\\text{Polr,BestBuy}}=\\mu_{\\text{Polr,Target}}\\)\n\\(H_1:\\) at least one mean for review polarity is different.\n\nFor both tests, \\(\\alpha=0.003\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Welch ANOVA Results (Polarity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nddof1\nddof2\nF\np-unc\nnp2\n\n\n\n\nsite\n2\n6112.904850\n1362.569459\n0.000000\n0.106472\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Welch ANOVA Results (Subjectivity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nddof1\nddof2\nF\np-unc\nnp2\n\n\n\n\nsite\n2\n6353.711848\n368.490784\n0.000000\n0.025819\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of both Welch ANOVA tests suggests that the means for review subjectivity and review polarity, given the website on which it was posted, have a statistically significant difference. We’ll seek to visualize these differences using a plot of the Tukey Honest Significance Test.\n\n\n2.5.3.2 Tukey Tests with E-Commerce Platform as Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Tukey Tests for Star Rating, Polarity, and Subjectivity, by-Site\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tukey honest significance tests, depicted in Figure 2.15 suggest some interesting patterns between the three websites. Namely, target and best buy seem to have higher polarity, and subjectivity than the same variables for Amazon! Additionally, for each variable and each website, it seems there is no overlap in the variables at the 99.7% confidence level.\nThese statistically significant differences between the reviews, treated by website, indicate to us that we should proceed with caution in our modeling phase. Namely, it may be necessary to include an explicit variable or feature accounting for the source website in our modeling process as a predictor for the response variable.",

To better support our calculated measures for subjectivity and polarity, we leveraged the langdetect library to attempt to classify the languages of each of our 45,000+ reviews collected.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Examples of reviews written in foreign languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsite\nreviewer_name\nreview_content\n\n\n\n\n11\nAmazon\nMoldea muy bien, me gustó mucho!

In our data exploration, we found that many of these false positives were outliers in other categories (whether for review length, review subjectivity, review polarity, or star rating). As such, we find it prudent to exclude these reviews from our dataset when pursuing model development.\nIn total, langdetect classified fewer than 440 reviews (accounting for less than 1% of our collected reviews) as being non-English, or being repeated words or gibberish. Excluding these reviews should have minimal impact on the pursuit of model development.\nTextBlob also offers us the ability to attempt to correct the spelling of reviews.

    "section": "2.7 Insights from Collection and EDA",
    "text": "2.7 Insights from Collection and EDA\nAs in Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022), we find that online reviews, this time across multiple websites, tend toward positivity. The values for star rating tend toward the 3 to 5 out of 5 star range, the polarity tends toward positive as star rating increases, and subjectivity (and one might argue, expressiveness) increases with star rating as well. These correlations can prove useful to us in our research.\nWe’ve also witnessed, tested, and verified that there is a statistically significant difference for review subjectivity and polarity, given the comment was hosted on a specific website. In light of these significant test results, we believe it may be necessary to account for the specific website from whence a review originates in training, testing, and validation data. The stark differences, without adjustment, could negatively impact the performance of any models if we fail to account for these differences therein.\nThe nature of the distribution of useful votes for a review poses a potential challenge to our research. The exponential distribution of useful votes could prove difficult to predict, as more and more useful votes become exceedingly rare for a given customer comment. As such, we may have an easier time with categorizing a review as being useful or not useful, in lieu of predicting a numeric value to represent how useful a comment is (e.g. predict the number of votes in favor of a comment as being useful to other customers).\nFurthermore, exclusion of outliers could also pose challenges to our research. When excluding outliers, since the distribution of star rating tends toward the more positive reviews and results (reference Figure 2.4), we could inadvertently build models that perform the same way and are less able or unable to effectively categorize the usefulness of a lower star-rated review comment. With the nature of these outliers and the fact that having a high number of useful votes in and of itself is an outlier, we may need to examine building models upon the normalized data (e.g. the filters applied in Figure 2.7 and Figure 2.9) as well as the negation of that normalization, focusing on the outliers, so as to ensure that all the cases for our models are covered.\n\n\n\n\nGuha Majumder, Madhumita, Sangita Dutta Gupta, and Justin Paul. 2022. “Perceived Usefulness of Online Customer Reviews: A Review Mining Approach Using Machine Learning & Exploratory Data Analysis.” Journal of Business Research 150 (November): 147–64. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.06.012.\n\n\nHu, Weishu, Zhiguo Gong, and Jingzhi Guo. 2010. “Mining Product Features from Online Reviews.” 2010 IEEE 7th International Conference on E-Business Engineering, November. https://doi.org/10.1109/icebe.2010.51.\n\n\nRajeev, P Venkata, and V Smrithi Rekha. 2015. “Recommending Products to Customers Using Opinion Mining of Online Product Reviews and Features.” 2015 International Conference on Circuits, Power and Computing Technologies [ICCPCT-2015], March. https://doi.org/10.1109/iccpct.2015.7159433.\n\n\nWang, W.

A key consideration for us is within the realm of recall in that false positives are potentially beneficial to the generalization of this model to identify reviews that are useful, but currently possess no helpful votes. None of the models delivered any false positives, but having high recall may support identification of new, useful comments.\nThe top 2 performing models were our Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression implementations. Between the two, SVM had higher recall, which is preferable in our use case. That being said, on every metric between the two models, there was near equivalent performance.\nWith our preferences toward higher recall, the implementation of the SVM-Sigmoid and SVM-RBF models delivered best on our objectives, identifying the highest volume of true positives, minimizing false negatives, and providing a limited number of true positives that could identify comments with no votes that are useful to customers.\nFrom a stakeholder standpoint, these two models can both be beneficial, whether looking from the standpoint of the customer or the e-commerce platform.\nThe RBF model, with more exploration and examination, could be very beneficial to e-commerce platforms. If the model could be modified and updated to identify comments that are closer in proximity to promotional comments (which potentially come at a cost to these platforms), it may allow them to present comments similar in quality to a paid promotional review without the platform having to pay for it.\nThe Sigmoid model, with additional training and tuning, could be of greater benefit to customers. This model is less inclined to capture promomtional feedback comments and provide potentially useful feedback absent other outside influence. At a subjective level, not all of the content contained in these classified reviews are useful, though many are. \n\n\n\n\nGuha Majumder, Madhumita, Sangita Dutta Gupta, and Justin Paul. 2022. “Perceived Usefulness of Online Customer Reviews: A Review Mining Approach Using Machine Learning & Exploratory Data Analysis.” Journal of Business Research 150 (November): 147–64. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.06.012.\n\n\nHu, Weishu, Zhiguo Gong, and Jingzhi Guo. 2010. “Mining Product Features from Online Reviews.” 2010 IEEE 7th International Conference on E-Business Engineering, November. https://doi.org/10.1109/icebe.2010.51.\n\n\nRajeev, P Venkata, and V Smrithi Rekha. 2015. “Recommending Products to Customers Using Opinion Mining of Online Product Reviews and Features.” 2015 International Conference on Circuits, Power and Computing Technologies [ICCPCT-2015], March. https://doi.org/10.1109/iccpct.2015.7159433.\n\n\nWang, W.

    "text": "3.3 Examination of the Original Multiple Linear Regression\n\n3.3.1 Inspection of Linear Model Assumptions\nGenerally, on examining the plot of fitted vs. observed values for the linear model, we feel our methods have produced similar outcomes as for Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022). The predicted values appear to have a slightly lesser scale and range than that of the observed values.\n\n3.3.1.1 Linearity of the Model\nOur version of the linear model is designed as follows: \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0+\\beta_1X_{rsr}+\\beta_2X_{rs}+\\beta_3X_{rp}+\\beta_4X_{rl}+\\beta_5X_{ps}+\\beta_6X{tsr}\\)\nWhere each of the following variables have been standard-scaled to a range between 0 and 1 for the input data:\n\n\\(X_{rsr}\\) corresponds to the individual review’s star rating\n\\(X_{rs}\\) corresponds to the review’s subjectivity score\n\\(X_{rp}\\) corresponds to the review’s polarity score\n\\(X_{rl}\\) corresponds to the review’s length (in words)\n\\(X_{ps}\\) corresponds to the product description subjectivity score (replacement for the binary settings for search, experience, or mixed goods from Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022)’s model).\n\\(X_{tsr}\\) is the overall star rating for the product.\n\nWith this construct, we proceeded to generate a linear model trained on our standard scaled data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Linear Relationship Between Predictors and Response\n\n\n\n\n\nOur testing produced the following coefficients:\n\\(\\beta_0\\): 0.449, \\(\\beta_1\\): 0.219,\\(\\beta_2\\): 4.497,\\(\\beta_3\\): -0.018,\\(\\beta_4\\): 0.002,\\(\\beta_5\\): -0.001,\\(\\beta_6\\): -0.006\nOn new training data, the model appears to underpredict the output value, across the board, for the new data. That being said, there is still a strong linear trend between the predictors and the response. The intent of this model is not to predict the actual number of votes that a review might have, but whether or not that review would be considered useful to customers.\nGenerally examining this result, we would conclude that there is a linear trend between these features, their coefficients, and their corresponding response.\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Homoscedasticity on Normalized Data\nThis model has substantial challenges with heteroscedasticity. Let’s examine a plot of fitted vs. residuals in the model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Heteroscedasticity in Model\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear linear pattern in the residuals of this plot. It seems that the test data may have other linear factors associated with it. If we adjust the output to this additional linear factor, we can examine for heteroscedasticity in the adjusted plot.\nPerforming a further linear regression on the fitted vs. observed values, we identified a slope \\(\\beta_{1^*}\\) of approximately 1.44 and intercept of \\(\\beta_{0^*}\\) of approximately 0.003. Adjusting the predictions and plotting the re-fitted vs. observed values, we see the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Heteroscedasticity in Adjusted Model\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot also appears to have issues with non-constant variance in the residuals. As we traverse from left to right on this plot, the magnitude of the residuals appears to shrink or reduce.\nOnce again, the output of this model is not necessarily to predict the precise value of the number of votes a review comment will have, but instead to project how useful this vote would be perceived by new customers. Although the issues with heteroscedasticity do exist for this model, we still find that the output of this model is potentially useful.\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Normality in Residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Model Residuals are Abnormal\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above plot, it is clear that this model fails to adhere to the multiple linear regression requirement for residual normality.\n\n\n3.3.1.4 Conclusion on MLR model\nWe conclude that the MLR model is not a statistically well-performing model for the purpose of predicting the number of helpful votes a review comment will receive.\nThat being said, in spite of its violations of the assumptions of multiple linear regression, we do find that the model is useful in predicting a relative usefulness score for a given review comment. If all comments in a thread for a specific product were run against this model, we believe that the model will reflect the relative usefulness of a comment with respect to other comments in the same thread. Sorting and organizing comments based on the maximum output value could bring the most useful comments to the top of the queue for review by potential shoppers.\nWe’ll examine the per-product correlation next:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving pursued the suggested research of Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022) and producing similar results, we will proceed to evaluate other models for detecting useful comments.",

It determines the performance of the model. Usually a small k value leads to overly complex understanding of the data that might result into overfitting, however, a higher k values can lead to underfitting.\nWe have looked at multiple values of k for our given data and compared a set of model metrics - accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall to find the most optimal model to be the model with k = 3.\nLooking the results shown below we can say that:\n\nJust by looking at the accuracy for any given value of k, it ranges between 98-99% indicating that KNN might be a good model for the given data.\nAmong the evaluated models, KNN with k = 3 achieves the highest F1 score of approximately 78.2%, indicating a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.\nWhile all models have high precision and recall rates, KNN with higher k values (5, 7, and 9) demonstrate slightly lower F1 scores.\n\n\n\n3.5.2 KNN Test Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nUseful Level\nAccuracy\nF1\nPrecision\nRecall\n\n\n\n\nKNN (k=3)\nabove 0\n0.731992\n0.480493\n0.977716\n0.318512\n\n\nKNN (k=5)\nabove 0\n0.727048\n0.462821\n0.988131\n0.302178\n\n\nKNN (k=7)\nabove 0\n0.720339\n0.443038\n0.984375\n0.285844\n\n\nKNN (k=9)\nabove 0\n0.714689\n0.424501\n0.986755\n0.270417",

    "text": "3.2 Data Adjustments\nAs noted in our exploratory data analysis, each individual site has statistically significant differences in key variables we’re considering in our modeling. To mitigate the potential for under or overfitting, and misrepresentation due to variable scale we perform the following transformations to our data:\n\n\nVariable outlier adjustment. We noted in our EDA that each of the e-commerce platforms had high volumes of outliers with respect to the inter-quartile range. We applied a transformation to our data to map any outlier variable value on a per-website basis from its value to \\(\\mu+3\\cdot sd(\\text{variable})\\) for high-end outliers, and \\(\\mu-3\\cdot sd(\\text{variable})\\) for low-end outliers. In the event that either of these values exceeded the minimum or maximum value of the dataset, we mapped the value to the minimum or maximum accordingly.\nStandard scaling of variables. After adjusting outliers, we re-mapped all of our feature variables to be on the scale of the standard normal distribution \\(N\\sim(0,1)\\)\nResponse variable transformation to binary value.

Logisitic regression enables us to examine the inclusion of additional categorical variables as part of the regression consideration.\n\n3.4.1 Hyperparameter Tuning\nLogistic regression is one of the best performing models in the project after SVM. There are 3 logistic regression models - one was tuned using the class weight hyperparameter to address the class imbalance present in the dataset. By assigning a higher weight to the minority class (useful level 1) and a lower weight to the majority class (useful level 0), the model was able to better capture the patterns associated with the minority class, leading to improved performance metrics.\n\n\n3.4.2 Oversampling techniques\nAdditionally, 2 more logistic regression models are trained using two oversampling techniques, namely ADASYN and SMOTE. ADASYN, which generates synthetic samples for the minority class based on their difficulty in learning regions, and SMOTE, which creates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples, were used to address the class imbalance problem. These techniques help to provide the model with more balanced training data, allowing it to learn the characteristics of both classes more effectively.\nIt is a well know fact that oversampling techniques are employed if there a severe class imbalance if hyperparameter tuning does not improve the model performance. However, despite the heavy class imbalance, the tuned model and the SMOTE model achieve great result with 98% accuracy indicating that it is proficient at making correct predictions. 68% recall is decent, but indicates that the model maybe classifying the positive instances from minority class incorrectly.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Logistic Regression Test Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nUseful Level\nAccuracy\nF1\nPrecision\nRecall\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression (TUNED)\nabove 0\n0.795551\n0.643692\n1.000000\n0.474592\n\n\nLogistic Regression (ADASYN)\nabove 0\n0.794138\n0.640345\n1.000000\n0.470962\n\n\nLogistic Regression (SMOTE)\nabove 0\n0.790254\n0.631056\n1.000000\n0.460980",

Because of its flexibility of moving the hyperplane and adapting to the intricacies of the data, SVM proves to be a powerful algorithm.\n\n3.6.1 Hyperparameter Tuning\nThe complexity of a SVM model is determined by the choice of kernel function that allows to capture all nuances of the data. Below are the implmentation results of the performance metrics of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models trained with different kernel functions: polynomial (SVM-Poly), radial basis function (SVM-RBF), and sigmoid (SVM-Sigmoid).\nTo tune each version of this model, we leveraged a reduced set of principal components, and adjusted class weighting, as having useful votes for a product is a relative rarity across each of the e-commerce platforms. To boost our recall, we elected to assign weights of 0.1 to class 0 (not useful) and 0.9 to class 1 (useful).\n\n\n3.6.2 SVM Test Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nUseful Level\nAccuracy\nF1\nPrecision\nRecall\n\n\n\n\nSVM-Poly\nabove 0\n0.785664\n0.619912\n1.000000\n0.449183\n\n\nSVM-RBF\nabove 0\n0.781780\n0.612782\n0.989879\n0.443739\n\n\nSVM-Sigmoid\nabove 0\n0.737288\n0.583893\n0.760933\n0.473684\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking the results shown below we can say that:\n\nSVM with a polynomial kernel (SVM-Poly) achieves the highest F1 score of approximately 81.09%. This model also exhibits perfect precision, indicating that it classifies all positive instances correctly.\nSVM with a radial basis function kernel (SVM-RBF) follows closely with an F1 score of approximately 78.15%. Although it has slightly lower precision compared to SVM-Poly, it demonstrates a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.\nSVM with a sigmoid kernel (SVM-Sigmoid) exhibits the lowest F1 score of approximately 59.24%, indicating comparatively lower performance in capturing both precision and recall.\n\nWhile all SVM models exhibit high accuracy, SVM with a polynomial kernel (SVM-Poly) emerges as the most favorable choice based on its highest F1 score and perfect precision.\n\nRBF, unexpectedly, seems to associate being part of a promotion with a comment being useful. It’s possible that other comments in this group have similar features and qualities to promotional review comments. These results are sorted by the probability that they would be classified has having votes flagging them as being useful. The highest\nWhat about sigmoid?\nSigmoid seems to identify a wider variety of comments, some (subjectively) useful, some not, and identifies fewer items that were part of a promotion.",
