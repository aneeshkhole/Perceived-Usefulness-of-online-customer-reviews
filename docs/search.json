According to research by Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022), if a customer can gather and understand product quality before the purchase, it is considered a search good, while experience goods are those which must be purchased or experienced to evaluate them. When a product is more in the directon of experience vs. search-based, other customers’ experiences can shed light on its features and return on investment than information directly from the vendor can. Having reviews from reliable sources with sufficiently detailed information can enable greater confidence in a purchase, improved customer satisfaction, and smooth the process of ecommerce for customers.\nWe seek to expound upon the research of (Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul 2022) to explore additional recommended research areas to improve upon and increase the general applicability of the model.",

We further seek to inspect additional potential modifiers to the underlying model for statistical and operational applicability; we’ve sought out work from other research teams to identify potential methods we can leverage to pursue these ends.\n\nDetermining the polarity of a customer review by employing a classifier such as Naive Bayes.\nUsing Kansei engineering approaches to convert unstructured product-related texts into feature–affective opinions.\nAttempting to assess the reliability of a customer’s review based on star-rating and a ‘sentiment score’ of their textual feedback.\n\nExploring methods employed within each of combinations of these research efforts, we will pursue potential improvements on the models outlined in Guha Majumder, Dutta Gupta, and Paul (2022).

    "text": "1.3 Why It Matters\n\nFeedback from customers can be beneficial to both vendors and consumers, but it is not always ordered by the most informative or beneficial feedback first. Certain features of products, reviews, and reviewers (such as reviewer reliability, review quality, product quality, specificity and detail of the product, amongst others) can impact the usefulness of the feedback on a customer-by-customer basis. Level of detail, star-rating, and number of votes that support the review as being useful to a customer can all help determine its usefulness to other customers. Leveraging metrics and data associated with a product, a review, and a reviewer together may allow for online vendors to improve consumer e-commerce experience, support identificaion of issues with product quality and sales, and enable vendors to adjust practices in product marketing, inventory, and manufacture.\nExamining additional product types could support a generalization of the authors’ methodology to other products. Furthermore, the exploration of a sliding scale for search vs. experience-based products can further support generalization and business goals. Producing a reliable scale and methods for classifying a products’ degree of being experienced-based can inform vendors on:\n\nHow to best sort product reviews\nExamine what are the most helpful reviews to know the performance of the product alongside customer experience and sentiment\nAdjust the product, its marketing, or future production based upon market efficacy\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the emotions a customer wants to express through a review is crucial as it will affect the “recommendation score” of that particular product or a different one from a similar category. \n\nTo contribute in determining this recommendation score, we can use a probabilistic machine learning algorithm like Naive Bayes to determine the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of customer reviews.\nTypically used for amending product design, Kansei Engineering can be used to incorporate human emotional responses into evaluation of a customer review. \n\nDetermine which customer is trustworthy, meaning who has actually purchased the product versus a customer who gave a false review. Based on the ‘customer reputation score’, our aim is to classify customers into groups to judge reviewer reliability. This has two main aspects:\n\nStar-rating score which is a discrete scale that tells the inclination of a customer.\nText review ‘sentiment score’ using NLP that explains customer opinions based on words.",
